    <h1>Things I Wish I Knew Before Working in Industry</h1>

    <p>In April 2008, a representative from IBM gave a presentation at Georgia
Tech about things he wished he knew before working in the the software
industry. I have found his advice to be very useful at various points during
my career. Sadly I have lost the presenter&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>Here is my outline of his presentation. <strong>Emphasized</strong> points are ones I&rsquo;ve found
to be particularly useful.</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<ul>
<li>Future: integration</li>
<li>Needed: ease-of-use &amp; less complexity</li>
<li>Do <em>not</em> reinvent wheels!

<ul>
<li>you&rsquo;ll never finish the project</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Technical Knowledge</h3>

<ul>
<li>Learn to learn</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t need to take a class to learn something</li>
<li>Learn a little about a lot of things</li>
<li>Read news highlights from worthwhile sources</li>
</ul>


<h3>Problem Solving</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build a network of people. Asking for advice is quicker than learning the hard way.</strong></li>
<li>There is always more than one way to do something.<br/>
Weigh the pros/cons of each – then pick and choose.</li>
<li>Innovate <em>before</em> you execute. Think critically before you act.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Business &amp; Technology</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Technology adoption is driven by <em>business</em>. (practicality)</strong></li>
<li>Business is nothing without technology.<br/>
Technology is nothing without business.</li>
<li>If you build a better mousetrap, they will not come.</li>
<li>A project, no matter how advanced, is doomed for failure without a paying customer.</li>
<li>Think about TCO (<em>total</em> cost of ownership) and ROI (return on investment).<br/>
You must always justify your returns.</li>
<li><strong>Communication with <em>managers</em> and <em>customers</em> is vital!</strong><br/>
If you can&rsquo;t get someone to adopt your solution, what&rsquo;s the point?</li>
<li>There is a difference between removing barriers and creating incentive (for a customer to switch to my project/product). You need both.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Promotions</h3>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not <em>what</em> you know.<br/>
It&rsquo;s not <em>who</em> you know.<br/>
<strong>It&rsquo;s <em>who</em> knows <em>what</em> you know.</strong></li>
<li>Doing more of the same is not enough.

<ul>
<li>Need to try new things – take on more responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Doing what is asked is not enough.</li>
<li>Ask you manager what the expectations are.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Working with Others</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Credit + gratitude are not limited resources.</strong>

<ul>
<li>Say thank you!</li>
<li>Give credit where due.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be ambitious but be humble.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t make assumptions about others.

<ul>
<li>Give people the benefit of the doubt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Your lack of planning does not mean I need to treat your request as urgent.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Do what you say you will. Keep your word.

<ul>
<li>reliable</li>
<li>dependable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The best humor is <em>self-deprecating</em>.</li>
<li>There is always someone faster, smarter, and better looking.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Managers</h3>

<ul>
<li>They don&rsquo;t have a magic wand. They don&rsquo;t automatically fix problems.</li>
<li>Managers do not have a superset of the employees' (team members') knowledge.</li>
<li>Managers can&rsquo;t read minds. Don&rsquo;t assume. Communicate explicitly.</li>
<li>You are responsible for your own career. But ask for help.</li>
</ul>


<h3>You and Your Job</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your job is what you make of it. Don&rsquo;t be confined by a job description.</li>
<li>Work/Life balance doesn&rsquo;t have good default settings. You must do <em>explicit</em> actions.

<ul>
<li>plan</li>
<li>schedule for success</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are not your job. Do not define yourself like this.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Workers</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>We&rsquo;re employed to <em>add value</em>, not spend money.</strong></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easy to stay busy, but are you accomplishing anything <em>worthwhile</em>?

<ul>
<li>don&rsquo;t needlessly clutter your schedule</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you aren&rsquo;t looking at it from a <em>customer perspective</em>, you aren&rsquo;t looking at it.</li>
<li><strong>You can&rsquo;t do everything. Pick what you <em>won&rsquo;t</em> do.</strong> (The world won&rsquo;t end.)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Employment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t expect your first job to be your dream job. Look for a <em>path</em>, not an <em>endpoint</em>.</li>
<li>Be willing to stretch your comfort zone.

<ul>
<li>geographically, work type, etc.</li>
<li>Otherwise you&rsquo;ll stagnate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Know your employer&rsquo;s business model.

<ul>
<li>Examples:

<ul>
<li>HP = selling ink;</li>
<li>Microsoft = selling Office and Windows;</li>
<li>Apple = iPod and (to some extent) Macs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take a look at the annual reports for your company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Get <em>internships</em>, even if with competitors, maybe even delaying graduation.</strong>

<ul>
<li>It gives experience.</li>
<li>Increases employment opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start looking and prepare much earlier.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Successful Employment</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you want to make a difference, look for chaos.<br/>
Stable environments offer little opportunity.</li>
<li>Good employees <em>deal</em> with challenges instead of pouting. <em>Adapt</em>.</li>
<li>Stay above the commodity line (with regard to skill set and type of work done).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Life</h3>

<ul>
<li>Understand other people&rsquo;s <em>motivations</em>.

<ul>
<li>Makes it easier to find new ways of solving the underlying goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define your values and goals.

<ul>
<li>ex: What type of job do you want?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your <em>behaviors</em> should support your goals.</li>
<li>Expect your goals to change. Success is dynamic.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t let <em>others</em> define success for you.</li>
<li>You can get rich by getting more or <em>wanting less</em>.</li>
<li>Life is one great balancing act.

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s no single right way of doing things.</li>
<li>Balancing your priorities and goals is important.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <li id="Productivity<p><em><b>TLDR:</b> Drupal is overly complex for a personal blog. It is hard to maintain. Simple static site generators are easier to work with in the long term.</em></p>

<p>My portfolio website was written during college using hand-coded HTML and used server-side includes to bring in common navigation.</p>

<p>Then in January 2010 I remade my site in Drupal. It gained lots of fancy features such as first-class support for project categories and project languages. You could subscribe to almost any page as a feed. There were project specific updates that could be commented on. From a feature point of view, it rocked.</p>

<p>But some problems became apparent over time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security updates were frequent and difficult to apply correctly.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t like writing articles on the site because I couldn&rsquo;t use simple markup formats such as Markdown.

<ul>
<li>Drupal has no good editor plugins for markup languages.</li>
<li>And its visual HTML editor generates messy HTML.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The theme I used for the site was complex and hard to modify.

<ul>
<li>And the CSS often interfered with my article markup, necessitating me to drop into HTML when editing certain articles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There was no sane way to test structural changes to the site locally and then automatically deploy them to production.

<ul>
<li>Normally this would be done by keeping the site structure in the filesystem and all user content in a database. This allows the filesystem contents to be easily deployed using <code>git push</code>, <code>rsync</code>, or similar techniques.</li>
<li>Drupal, by contrast, keeps its site structure in both the filesystem <em>and</em> in the database, along with user-generated content. Updating only the parts of the database related to site structure is cumbersome and error-prone.</li>
<li>Thus, I couldn&rsquo;t really change the site structure after my initial deployment to production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nothing was in revision control, which made me nervous.</li>
<li>I had to hack the Drupal core to get my contact form to work with my web hosting provider.</li>
<li>Most of the features of the site weren&rsquo;t being used by readers.</li>
</ul>


<p>So now I am rewriting my site yet again in straight HTML (via a simple static site generator) and outsourcing all user generated content (like comments) to third party service providers.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple simple simple.</li>
<li>Automatic security. The web server just serves static files.</li>
<li>Automatic scalability, for the same reason.</li>
<li>Simple authoring in Markdown with powerful client-side text editors.</li>
<li>Instant deployment with <code>git push</code>.</li>
<li>Everything in revision control.</li>
<li>I can use any web hosting provider. Hell, I can just use <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> for free.</li>
<li>Ultimate control over the site theme and CSS. I can fix problems myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>My experience using various kinds of writing utensils in school&hellip;</p>

<p><i>&gt; = &ldquo;is better than&rdquo;</i></p>

<h3>Why Pens > Pencils</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t smudge ∴ Archive well</li>
<li>Force you to think about what you are writing

<ul>
<li>Mistakes are more costly, since you cannot simply use an eraser on pen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have brighter contrast ∴ Easier to read</li>
</ul>


<h3>Why Mechanical Pencils > Traditional Pencils</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t need to be sharpened ∴

<ul>
<li>No sawdust to clean up</li>
<li>No special sharpener hardware needed</li>
<li>Lifetime is not limited to a certain number of sharpenings

<ul>
<li>Lifetime only limited to when the m-pencil is lost</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seem to resist smearing in the short term

<ul>
<li>(but pens still win in the long term)</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently upgraded from an iPod Touch to an iPhone 3GS. I hate contracts, so I
bought the 3GS off-contract from a seller on Craigslist. (And I timed my
purchase to coincide with the release of the iPhone 4, so lots of people were
dumping their own 3GS devices.)</p>

<p>I am routinely in WiFi hotspots: at home, enroute to work, and at work, so I
usually put the iPhone 3GS in &ldquo;Airplane Mode&rdquo;, where the wireless radios are
disabled, to conserve battery life. Therefore I effectively use my iPhone like
a better iPod Touch most of the time.</p>

<h2>The uneasy marriage with AT&amp;T</h2>

<p>I hate expensive monthly fees. Here in the USA, the only officially
supported carrier is AT&amp;T, which charges at least $70/month. I don&rsquo;t even use
the voice plan, so I&rsquo;m being overcharged rather significantly at the moment.</p>

<p>T-Mobile is another option for those willing to unlock their iPhones. They
have less expensive plans, to the tune of $40/month, which I&rsquo;m much in favor
of. I intend to unlock my iPhone when I get some spare time in the next month
or so. After all, it&rsquo;s costing me $30/month to delay.</p>

<p><strong>2012 Update:</strong> T-Mobile is rumored to be carrying the iPhone sometime in
2013. I just hope it isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;too little, too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>2012 Update:</strong> I am still using the same iPhone 3GS today.</p>
-topic"><a href="/articles/topics/#Productivity<p><em><b>TLDR:</b> Drupal is overly complex for a personal blog. It is hard to maintain. Simple static site generators are easier to work with in the long term.</em></p>

<p>My portfolio website was written during college using hand-coded HTML and used server-side includes to bring in common navigation.</p>

<p>Then in January 2010 I remade my site in Drupal. It gained lots of fancy features such as first-class support for project categories and project languages. You could subscribe to almost any page as a feed. There were project specific updates that could be commented on. From a feature point of view, it rocked.</p>

<p>But some problems became apparent over time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security updates were frequent and difficult to apply correctly.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t like writing articles on the site because I couldn&rsquo;t use simple markup formats such as Markdown.

<ul>
<li>Drupal has no good editor plugins for markup languages.</li>
<li>And its visual HTML editor generates messy HTML.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The theme I used for the site was complex and hard to modify.

<ul>
<li>And the CSS often interfered with my article markup, necessitating me to drop into HTML when editing certain articles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There was no sane way to test structural changes to the site locally and then automatically deploy them to production.

<ul>
<li>Normally this would be done by keeping the site structure in the filesystem and all user content in a database. This allows the filesystem contents to be easily deployed using <code>git push</code>, <code>rsync</code>, or similar techniques.</li>
<li>Drupal, by contrast, keeps its site structure in both the filesystem <em>and</em> in the database, along with user-generated content. Updating only the parts of the database related to site structure is cumbersome and error-prone.</li>
<li>Thus, I couldn&rsquo;t really change the site structure after my initial deployment to production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nothing was in revision control, which made me nervous.</li>
<li>I had to hack the Drupal core to get my contact form to work with my web hosting provider.</li>
<li>Most of the features of the site weren&rsquo;t being used by readers.</li>
</ul>


<p>So now I am rewriting my site yet again in straight HTML (via a simple static site generator) and outsourcing all user generated content (like comments) to third party service providers.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple simple simple.</li>
<li>Automatic security. The web server just serves static files.</li>
<li>Automatic scalability, for the same reason.</li>
<li>Simple authoring in Markdown with powerful client-side text editors.</li>
<li>Instant deployment with <code>git push</code>.</li>
<li>Everything in revision control.</li>
<li>I can use any web hosting provider. Hell, I can just use <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> for free.</li>
<li>Ultimate control over the site theme and CSS. I can fix problems myself.</li>

<p>I recently upgraded from an iPod Touch to an iPhone 3GS. I hate contracts, so I
bought the 3GS off-contract from a seller on Craigslist. (And I timed my
purchase to coincide with the release of the iPhone 4, so lots of people were
dumping their own 3GS devices.)</p>

<p>I am routinely in WiFi hotspots: at home, enroute to work, and at work, so I
usually put the iPhone 3GS in &ldquo;Airplane Mode&rdquo;, where the wireless radios are
disabled, to conserve battery life. Therefore I effectively use my iPhone like
a better iPod Touch most of the time.</p>

<h2>The uneasy marriage with AT&amp;T</h2>

<p>I hate expensive monthly fees. Here in the USA, the only officially
supported carrier is AT&amp;T, which charges at least $70/month. I don&rsquo;t even use
the voice plan, so I&rsquo;m being overcharged rather significantly at the moment.</p>

<p>T-Mobile is another option for those willing to unlock their iPhones. They
have less expensive plans, to the tune of $40/month, which I&rsquo;m much in favor
of. I intend to unlock my iPhone when I get some spare time in the next month
or so. After all, it&rsquo;s costing me $30/month to delay.</p>

<p><strong>2012 Update:</strong> T-Mobile is rumored to be carrying the iPhone sometime in
2013. I just hope it isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;too little, too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>2012 Update:</strong> I am still using the same iPhone 3GS today.</p>

<p>It occurs to me that anime has been an important driver for improving my programming abilities.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>I did my own <a href="/prism/projects/kiss/">implementation of the Kisekae Set System</a> (KiSS),
a digital paper doll system which often featured anime characters.

<ul>
<li>My very first exposure to anime was to the characters of Wedding Peach,
via an included doll file with the French KiSS viewer by John Stiles.</li>
<li>Taught me how to write directly to graphics buffers, in both C and
later Java.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I initially picked up Java when I was writing <strong>RealMediaFixer</strong>,
a repairer of RealMedia video files. CodeWarrior&rsquo;s implementation of the
C++ iostream classes had a broken buffered stream implementation,
so I switched to Java to use its rock solid BufferedOutputStream
implementation.

<ul>
<li>Initial use was to repair <a href="http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=396">Ranma</a> episodes that I downloaded over HTTP,
on dialup!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I implemented <a href="/prism/projects/hotline/">my own client and server for the Hotline protocol</a>,
through which I got most of my anime prior to the introduction of
BitTorrent.</li>
<li>Today I am <a href="/projects/handbrake-subtitle-support/">enhancing support for transcoding soft subtitles in HandBrake</a>

<h2>The uneasy marriage with AT&amp;T</h2>

<p>I hate expensive monthly fees. Here in the USA, the only officially
supported carrier is AT&amp;T, which charges at least $70/month. I don&rsquo;t even use
the voice plan, so I&rsquo;m being overcharged rather significantly at the moment.</p>

<p>T-Mobile is another option for those willing to unlock their iPhones. They
have less expensive plans, to the tune of $40/month, which I&rsquo;m much in favor
of. I intend to unlock my iPhone when I get some spare time in the next month
or so. After all, it&rsquo;s costing me $30/month to delay.</p>

<p><strong>2012 Update:</strong> T-Mobile is rumored to be carrying the iPhone sometime in
2013. I just hope it isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;too little, too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>2012 Update:</strong> I am still using the same iPhone 3GS today.</p>
">Personal<p>I love programming. It tickles me when I stumble across a new programming language that lets me express concepts in a more clear and direct fashion. I love the cleanness and order that results after a good round of refactoring<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I enjoy the challenge of hacking away at a fiddly problem and testing all the cases to get a correct and bulletproof solution.</p>

<p>However I have realized programming is merely an activity. It is a <em>means</em>, not an <em>end</em>. My work is not inherently valuable because I have created a piece of software. Rather it is because I have created software <em>that solves somebody&rsquo;s problem</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Therefore it is the <em>problem</em> that deserves the most attention if you want to make a difference that people care about. In that vein I have been learning about the precepts of Customer Development and Customer Discovery, which deals with how to efficiently interact with customers to discover a problem that they care about.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Direct customer interaction, such as through in-person interviews of the general public, is way outside my comfort zone. However I will persevere. I think it is a very important skill for actually making a dent in the universe.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Previously this site was powered by the <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> engine. I found it overly
complex to maintain, especially for a single-user blog and portfolio website.

<p>It occurs to me that anime has been an important driver for improving my programming abilities.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>I did my own <a href="/prism/projects/kiss/">implementation of the Kisekae Set System</a> (KiSS),
a digital paper doll system which often featured anime characters.

<ul>
<li>My very first exposure to anime was to the characters of Wedding Peach,
via an included doll file with the French KiSS viewer by John Stiles.</li>
<li>Taught me how to write directly to graphics buffers, in both C and
later Java.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I initially picked up Java when I was writing <strong>RealMediaFixer</strong>,
a repairer of RealMedia video files. CodeWarrior&rsquo;s implementation of the
C++ iostream classes had a broken buffered stream implementation,
so I switched to Java to use its rock solid BufferedOutputStream
implementation.

<ul>
<li>Initial use was to repair <a href="http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=396">Ranma</a> episodes that I downloaded over HTTP,
on dialup!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I implemented <a href="/prism/projects/hotline/">my own client and server for the Hotline protocol</a>,
through which I got most of my anime prior to the introduction of
BitTorrent.</li>
<li>Today I am <a href="/projects/handbrake-subtitle-support/">enhancing support for transcoding soft subtitles in HandBrake</a>
so that I can watch new anime on the bus.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently upgraded from an iPod Touch to an iPhone 3GS. I hate contracts, so I
bought the 3GS off-contract from a seller on Craigslist. (And I timed my
purchase to coincide with the release of the iPhone 4, so lots of people were
dumping their own 3GS devices.)</p>

<p>I am routinely in WiFi hotspots: at home, enroute to work, and at work, so I
usually put the iPhone 3GS in &ldquo;Airplane Mode&rdquo;, where the wireless radios are
disabled, to conserve battery life. Therefore I effectively use my iPhone like
a better iPod Touch most of the time.</p>

<p>From purely a specification point of view, the differences are:</p>

## Copyrights

The first time that a piece of software is published, whether it be in binary or source form, it automatically gains copyright status. This is true even if you don't include the magic words `Copyright (c) 2013 David Foster`.[^magic_words]

[^magic_words]: However if you *do* include the magic words `Copyright (c) 2013 David Foster` it is easier to demonstrate *willful* infringement when you sue someone for infringing your copyright. Willful infringment entitles the copyright owner to higher *damages* (i.e. payments from the infringer) than vanilla infringement.

### Copyright grants the author certain exclusive rights.

That is, other people don't get these rights. Such rights include (but are not limited to):

* The right to *distribute* the software, even for free.
* The right to *sell* the software.

But then you might ask how download sites like Download.com can operate: If by default only the original author has the right to distribute the software they create, a download site would need to get special permission (i.e. a *license*) to distribute most programs on their site, which would be time consuming (and therefore expensive).

In reality, download sites generally rely on software authors to not *enforce* their copyrights. Which brings us to another point:

### Copyrights are useless unless they are enforced.

Enforcement takes the form of the copyright holder actively looking for *infringers*: other people who are distributing or selling the software without permission.

For example, the MPAA may issue a DMCA takedown request to a YouTube user who has (without permission) posted an episode of a TV show that MPAA owns. If the user does not comply with the takedown, the MPAA may sue the user for infringement.

## Licenses

### A copyright holder may waive or share some rights by issuing a *license*.

Licenses may be issued to individuals or companies. For example  a particular distributor may be granted the right to market and sell the software on behalf of the original developer.[^app_store]

For open source software, licenses are typically granted to the community as a whole (i.e. every recipient of the program). This is typically done by including a file called `LICENSE` or `COPYING` with the software. A license may also be found in the software's `README`.

You can write your own custom license (if you feel comfortable writing in legalese). Or you can use one of the more common existing licenses from the community. (See [Common Licenses](#common_licenses) below for a list.)

[^app_store]: If you sell any apps on the App Store, you signed an agreement giving Apple such marketing rights.

### Dual Licensing

Sometimes the same piece of software is offered under multiple licenses.

For example the Qt GUI toolkit has been available under both the GPL license and (with payment) a commercial closed-source license for a long time. Since companies don't like basing their own closed source software on GPL-licensed original software, this gives them an option to use a more corporate-friendly commercial license.

When creating a new piece of software that is based on or uses dual-licensed software, you should document which license the original software is being used under.

If you are the original author of a piece of software, you can issue a new version of the software under additional licenses.

### Changing a Software's License

Under rare circumstances, the license provided with software can change.

As the copyright holder of a piece of software, you may decide to release a new version with a different set of licenses than prior versions. For example you could change the license offered from [BSD](#bsd) to [GPL](#gpl), a rather radical change. Such a change would only be in effect for the newly released version - it would have no effect on older released versions.

If you are not the copyright holder of a piece of software, you cannot change the license(s) under which it is offered.

If there are contributors beyond the original author whose changes have been incorporated into the software, they become partial copyright holders in the software as well unless they explicitly waive their copyright interests via a Contributor Agreeement or similar document. In the event of multiple copyright holders, all holders must agree to any proposed changes in the set of licenses under which the software is offered. Since there may be a large number of contributors (and thus copyright holders), it may be impossible to get permission from everyone, thereby making a license change infeasible.

Projects that are particularly aware of copyright concerns may require all contributors to sign a Contributor Agreement that either waives all copyright interests or explicitly assigns the copyright associated with all contributions to the original author.[^splunk_assignment]

[^splunk_assignment]: For example my present company Splunk requires that all contributors to its open source projects sign a Contributor Agreement of this type.

### No Warranty

All software licenses I have seen explicitly disclaim all warranties. Meaning that if the software harms someone, you can't sue the developer for it. This is great for software developers but in my opinion bad for society.

<a name="common_licenses"></a>
### Common Licenses

Here are the most common open source licenses, arranged generally from most permissive to most restrictive.

If you don't care about the details and only want to know when to use which license, skip to the [summary](#license_summary).

<a name="mit"></a>
#### Public Domain[^pub_domain] <small>&mdash; ultimately permissive</small>

* Do whatever you want with this software.
* This software cannot ever be placed under copyright or any license.

[^pub_domain]: Technically the state of being in the "public domain" is not a license. Any work explicitly released into the public domain is not subject to copyright law at all. In particular there is no copyright holder and can never be a copyright holder in the future.

<a name="mit"></a>
#### MIT License <small>&mdash; super permissive, simple</small>

* Do whatever you want with this software.

<a name="bsd"></a>
#### BSD License <small>&mdash; permissive, simple</small>

* You can redistribute this software.
* (Other rights are not expressedly waived.)
* There are several [variants](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BSD_licenses&oldid=539421860) of this license.

<a name="apache"></a>
#### Apache 2.0 License <small>&mdash; permissive, complex</small>

* You can do anything normally restricted by copyright.
* You can do anything normally restricted by patent rights.
* Redistribution must be done under certain terms.
* Submissions by contributors automatically fall under
  this license unless specified otherwise.
* You may NOT use trademarks related to this software
  (except in a few special cases).

<a name="lgpl"></a>
#### LGPL License 2.1 <small>&mdash; restrictive, complex</small>

* You can redistribute this software.
* You can modify this software and distribute the derived work. However the derived work must also be LGPL-licensed.
* You can relicense a copy of this software under the GPL. (This is an irreversible action for works derived from the new copy.)
* If you create your own software that uses this LGPL-software, the license of your source code is unaffected. However the resulting *executable* and (sometimes) the *object code* must satisfy the following terms:
    * Modification of the executable and object code is permitted for personal use.
    * Reverse engineering of the executable and object code is permitted.
    * You must give notice that the executable and object code uses this software and that this software is licensed under the LGPL. You must also provide a copy of the LGPL license text.
    * If the software displays copyright notices during its operation (such as in an About box), the LGPL copyright notice for this software must be included and a reference to the full LGPL license text must be provided.
    * Either:
        * (1) Include the source code for this software (including any modifications you made to it) when distributing the executable and object code.
        * (2) Require that the user of the executable or object code have this software installed locally already, and use shared library mechanisms to link the executable against the (unmodified) local copy of this software.
    * If distributing an executable, the nondistributed form of your software must include any data or utility programs necessary to compile the executable.[^include_utility_programs]

[^include_utility_programs]: At face value this doesn't actually seem like a restriction. However the LGPL text cautions, "It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute."

<a name="gpl"></a>
#### GPL License 2.0 <small>&mdash; restrictive, complex, "viral"</small>

* You can redistribute the source code of this software.
* You can modify this software and distribute the derived work.  However the derived work must also be GPL-licensed.[^gpl_ambiguous_derived]
* You can distribute this software or any software you create based on it, in executable or object code form, provided that you also distribute the corresponding source code (or provide a written offer to do so).

[^gpl_ambiguous_derived]: The GPL is ambiguous with respect to whether a piece of software that you create based on the GPL-licensed software (including merely linking to it) should be considered a derivative work or not. If so, then the GPL is truly "viral": any piece of code that interfaces with GPL-licensed software must also be licensed under the GPL. If not, the GPL still specifies unambiguously that programs based on GPL-licensed software must be distributed with all accompanying source code. Neither proposition is tolerable for most corporate software entities.

### Choosing a License

It is best to pick the license whose terms convey the message you want to send:

* **Public Domain**
    * Do anything you want with this software. It is free forever.
* **MIT**
    * Do anything you want with this software. (Although I might change my mind later.)
* **BSD (4-clause)**
    * Do anything you want with this software, although I want to be attributed (i.e. mentioned as the original author). But I don't want my name used to promote other things.
* **Apache**
    * You can do most things with this software.  
      (And my lawyers want a precise definition of what "most things" means.)
* **LGPL**
    * I want the source code for this software library (and any derived software) to be freely available forever. I also want to enforce that all improvements to this software library that are incorporated into other products be available for independent inspection.
    * I don't care if these extra terms made it burdensome for commercial entities to use my library, although I would like to make it possible for them to still use it if desired.
* **GPL**
    * I want the source code for this software library and any external software that uses it to be freely available forever.
    * I don't care if this means that my software will never be incorporated into a commercial product.
* **Copyright Notice; No License**
    * Don't even think about incorporating this software into another product, or selling it.
* **No Copyright Notice; No License**
    * I don't know about copyright or licenses. Ask me if you want to do something with my software.

Now that I've figured all of this out, it's time to update the licenses I'm using for [my own open source projects](https://github.com/davidfstr?tab=repositories).
Last week I decided to update one of my larger Python 2.7 projects to support Unicode fully
and to run under Python 3.

Here are the steps that I took and some gotchas I ran into along the way.

## General Strategy

Create and fully automate the unit test suite:

* This is important to detect any unexpected breakage from the Unicode-related changes you'll be making soon.
* Make sure your code coverage is good since tests can't protect you from mistakes introduced in uncovered code.

Identify all boundaries where data is being exchanged between the program and the outside environment. In my case:

* Direct I/O (i.e. `read` and `write`)
* Filesystem access (i.e. `open` and file paths)
* Process manipulation (via the `subprocess` module)
* Command-line arguments (via `sys.argv`)
* Time access (via the `time` module)

At boundaries:

* Reads should decode bytestrings to unicode using the proper encoding. You may need to do research to determine what the correct encoding is or how to determine the correct encoding at runtime.
    * Since my program did a lot of direct I/O on classic Mac OS data structures, the correct encoding was typically MacRoman.
    * `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` is sometimes appropriate. Be sure to test on Windows, where this value is typically not UTF-8.
* Writes should encode unicode (or ASCII bytestring literals) to bytestrings using the proper encoding.
* Ensure files and streams explicitly use either binary mode (i.e. `rb` or `wb`) or text mode (i.e. `rt` or `wt`).
    * UsuBytesIOally you want binary mode.
    * Text mode is required for certain cases, such as the output of the `json` module. Even then, it's a good idea to restrict text-based output to the ASCII character set since the native text encoding may not support the full Unicode set, particularly on Windows.

Finally:

* Run the `2to3` converter on your program so that it can be run by Python 3. 
* Run your new Python 3 source code in a Python 3 interpreter, perhaps inside a fresh Linux VM.
* Run your test suite under the Python 3 interpreter. It should find any Unicode mistakes that still need to be fixed.
* You will probably need to repeat this convert-test-fix cycle a couple of times.

## Special Cases

* Most uses of `StringIO` need to be migrated to `BytesIO`, when used as a byte buffer. If used as a string buffer, the `StringIO` uses need to be left at `StringIO`.
    * Here's the shim I used to support `BytesIO` and `StringIO` in both Python 2 and 3. I put it in a utility module and the rest of the program imports the shims instead of using the standard library.

<pre>
# BytesIO presents a stream interface to an in-memory bytestring.
# 
# This is equivalent to StringIO in Python 2 and to BytesIO in Python 3.
try:
    from io import BytesIO              # Python 3
except ImportError:
    from StringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

# StringIO presents a stream interface to an in-memory string
# (which is a bytestring in Python 2 and a unicode string in Python 3).
# 
# This is equivalent to StringIO in both Python 2 and 3.
try:
    from StringIO import StringIO
except ImportError:
    from io import StringIO             # Python 3
</pre>

* When writing to a binary stream, replace uses of `output.write(chr(byte_ordinal))` with `output.write(bchr(byte_ordinal))` and use the following shim for `bchr`:

<pre>
# bchr() converts the specified byte integer value to a single character
# bytestring.
# 
# This is equivalent to chr() in Python 2 but requires special handling in
# Python 3.
if bytes == str:
    def bchr(byte_ordinal):
        return chr(byte_ordinal)
else:
    def bchr(byte_ordinal):
        return bytes([byte_ordinal])    # Python 3
</pre>

* Beware of comparisons with `''`. Some of them probably need to be converted to comparisons with `b''`. For example, I had to adjust my `at_eof` utility function:

<pre>
def at_eof(input):
    """
    Returns whether the specified input stream is at EOF.
    """
    with save_stream_position(input):
        at_eof = input.read(1) == b''
    return at_eof
</pre>

* If your program uses human-readable ASCII bytestring literals, such as FourCC codes, make sure they are marked with the `b` prefix appropriately.

<pre>
if type_code == b'APPL':
</pre>

* Iteration over bytestrings works differently in Python 2 vs Python 3.
    * The code `for c in data:` will give back single-character bytestrings in Python 2 but byte ordinals in Python 3.
    * Here's my shim to let `for b in iterord(data):` always iterate over byte ordinals:

<pre>
# iterord() iterates over the integer values of the bytes in the specified
# bytestring.
if bytes == str:
    def iterord(bytes_value):           # Python 2
        for b in bytes_value:
            yield ord(b)
else:
    def iterord(bytes_value):           # Python 3
        return bytes_value
</pre>

* `time.strftime` returns a bytestring in Python 2 and a Unicode string in Python 3. Usually you want a Unicode string. I didn't create a shim for this since I only had one use of `strftime`.

<pre>
now_string = time.strftime('%b %d %H:%M', time.localtime(now))
if not isinstance(now_string, unicode):
    now_string = now_string.decode('ascii')
</pre>

* Regular expressions that are intended to apply to bytestrings instead of Unicode strings may need updating.
    * For example the pattern `re.compile(r'^Volume name is "(.*)"$')` which is designed to be applied to a MacRoman-encoded bytestring would need to be updated to read `re.compile(br'^Volume name is "(.*)"$')`

* Don't forget to update your documentation to specify where Unicode (or ASCII bytestring literals) are expected.It has been said that you can learn a lot from reading other people's high-quality software. So I gave it a try this weekend by reading the SQLite source.

SQLite is a lightweight embedded database that does not require a standalone server. It is designed to be reliable, highly portable, and require minimal administration.

SQLite has some of the [most rigorous testing methodology] I have seen in an open source project. Thus its true defect count is likely to be extremely low, making it high quality.

Such a high quality product probably contains useful patterns and techniques, some of which I could reuse in my own programs. So I decided to dive into the SQLite source and see what gems I could pull out. Here are my notes:

[most rigorous testing methodology]: https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html

## Architecture & Design

I started by reading the high-level design documentation. SQLite has exceptionally good documentation of this type.

* [Documentation Index] - *Root of all documentation.*

* [Architecture Documentation] - *Excellent overview of the architecture.*

* Query Planner Documentation - *Describes how prepared statements are executed.*
    * [The Virtual Database Engine]
    * [Virtual Machine Opcodes]

### Internal Tools of Note

#### [Fossil]

Distributed version control system used by SQLite. I've never heard of this. Beyond version control also provides bug tracking, a wiki, and a blog.

#### [Lemon]

A custom parser generator used by SQLite. Alternative to the old bison/yacc combination which has some improvements:

* Syntax that is less error-prone.
* Fast. Reentrant. Thread-safe.
* Easier to write parsers that avoid leaking memory upon error conditions.
    * Important since SQLite is serious about handling out of memory conditions.

#### [VFS]

OS abstraction layer. Despite the acronym (Virtual Filesystem), it is more than just filesystem manipulation routines.

## Implementation Notes

### table.c (sqlite3_get_table)

* This is the main entry point into the SQLite API.
  It executes a SQL statement and returns the result.

* First impression is that most methods have a lot of malloc-failed handling. And indeed if you read the testing procedures, they involve causing random malloc errors throughout the code, so there has to be handling for such errors.

* Hungarion notation is used as well. Ick. But at least it is consistent.
    * z = string
    * a = array
    * p = object pointer
    * n = int
    * x = function pointer

* `/* Assume 32-bit assignment is atomic */`
    * Interesting that such a property would be *consciously* relied on.

### legacy.c (sqlite3_exec)

* This is the legacy entry point into the SQLite API.
  It still exists and is actually used internally by the currently
  recommended API entry point (`sqlite3_get_table`).

* There are some odd syntactic conventions.
    * Multi-line comments use double-stars to prefix middle lines.
    * No space before closing `{`.
    * Spaces inside outer parentheses for most statements
      (`if`, `while`, `assert`) but not all (`for`).

* It appears that functions that begin with `sqlite3_` are public,
  whereas functions starting with `sqlite3` (no underscore) are private.


### vdbeapi.c (sqlite3_step)

* This function executes one or more instructions from the instruction list
  inside of a prepared SQL statement. The instruction is executed inside
  of the SQLite virtual database engine (VDBE), which is a virtual machine.
    * It has a lot of support code for EXPLAIN and profiling callbacks.
    * The meat of instruction execution is done by `sqlite3VdbeExec`.

* Contains own mutex implementation. (`sqlite3_mutex_enter`)

* Deals with a somewhat crazy circumstance: If the database schema changes
  in the middle of executing a (prepared) SQL statement, the statement is
  reprepared and rerun automatically.

* Generally there is good commenting for weird and backward-compatibility
  behaviors.

* Practically every function can fail. They all return an integer error code.
    * Some functions that operate on an in-out data structure will
      additionally store an error code (and message) in that structure.

### vdbe.c (sqlite3VdbeExec)

* This function executes as many instructions as possible from a prepared
  SQL statement. It contains the monsterous switch statement that 
  enumerates every possible opcode that can be executed.
    * Related reference documentation: [Virtual Machine Opcodes]
    * Related guide documentation: [The Virtual Database Engine]

### Future

* If I were to continue reading into the implementation,
  I think the opcodes that manipulate B-trees would likely be
  the most interesting ones to look at.

## Summary

This is a very high-quality C library.

* Internal commenting is good.
* Consistent syntax is used, despite being a bit odd IMHO.
* The guide-level documentation is wonderful.
* Error handling is air-tight and enforced by crazy amounts of test code. 
* The architecture provides good separation of roles and is easy to understand.
* Once again, the documentation is excellent.

And its design requirements show through in the implementation:

**Reliable**

* There is more than 1000 times as much test code as there is product code.
* 100% branch coverage. That's insanely good.
* Very crazy error classes such as out of memory errors, crashes, integer overflow are all considered and tested for.
    * Malloc checks are prevalent and handled.
    * Transactions, journaling, and related testing deal with crashes.

**Portable**

* The chosen language is C, which is highly portable when written in the appropriate style.
* The so-called VFS layer provides an OS abstraction. Thus porting to an OS mainly just involves writing a new implementation of this abstraction.
* All C files are combined into one giant C file before being sent to the compiler, which provides for better compile-time optimizations for dumber C compilers, which may occur on embedded systems.
* The database format does not depend on endianness or native data type sizes, making it suitable for cross-platform use.
* Very low memory configurations are available, making SQLite suitable for use on embedded devices such as cellphones.
* The code is in the public domain, which removes any licensing barriers.

**Simple**

* SQLite is embedded into the program that uses it, requiring no separate server. And no administration for such a server.
* Minimal schema is imposed by SQLite, distinguishing only between integers, reals, text, and blobs at a low level. And even so, a column's type is advisory only - you can store a value of any type in any column (except an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` column).

Of course being simple sacrifices certain other properties such as high concurrency and the ability to perform fine-grained access control (which requires administrability).

[Virtual Machine Opcodes]: http://www.sqlite.org/opcode.htmlI've been using [BBEdit] as my primary text editor on the Mac for over 10 years. It is an extremely capable and mature editor with just about all the bells and whistles you can imagine. However the use of Sublime Text has been spreading throughout my workplace at Splunk[^splunk] so I decided I'd give it a try.

My initial impression was "BBEdit can do everything that Sublime can, what's the deal?" But after using Sublime full-time for about a week, I'm starting to come around to it.

Although it is true that both have comparable feature sets, Sublime's implementation feels more polished - not just eyecandy, but actually better usability.

* Incremental find
    * As you start typing the substring you want to find, it automatically starts searching within the current document. Frequently you don't have to finish typing the substring in order to get the result you want.
    * This saves a surprising amount of time compared to BBEdit where you have to finish providing a full substring (that you think is long enough) before kicking off the search.
    * **Edit:** *This is actually available in BBEdit under the "Live Search" command, but this is not part of the default Find experience and not advertised.*
* View a file without "opening" it (as a persistent tab)
    * Sublime keeps files of current interest available as tabs in the main window. If you just click on a file, it is shown in the editor but no tab is created by default. If you decide this is an important file, you can double-click on the file name to create an actual tab for it, which makes the file easy to return to.
        * Most "Goto X" actions in Sublime both show a file and create an actual tab for it, which usually is what you want.
    * If you click on any file at all in BBEdit, it is "opened" and added to the "Currently Open Documents" section, which is analogous to Sublime's set of open tabs. This can result in the "Currently Open Documents" section getting rather cluttered when rummaging around for a particular document, making it less useful.
* Minidocument view on the right side of an open file.
    * This makes it easier to get a bird's eye view of where you are in a long function or file.

Additionally, Sublime's marketing has some a much better job of exposing advanced features that turn out to be useful in daily use.

* "Goto Anything"
    * BBEdit has similar "Open File by Name", but it's slower, doesn't have as expressive syntax, and isn't incremental.
* "Open Folder"
    * This is equivalent to a BBEdit project.
* Plugins!
    * This is barely advertised on the BBEdit side but hugely promoted on the Sublime side. Thus lots of people are writing (publicly available) plugins for Sublime but not so many for BBEdit.

Some features in Sublime are named more obviously:

* Convert Indentation to Spaces. Convert Indentation to Tabs.
    * BBEdit calls these operations "Detab" and "Entab" respectively.

Some features in Sublime are easier to access:

* Change the displayed tab width.
    * To change this for a single file in BBEdit, you have to go to "Show Fonts", which I find completely nonintuitive.
    * BBEdit also allows you to change the default tab spacing *per source language* in its preferences, which makes sense given that different languages have different conventions.
    * However BBEdit does not permit you to change the tab width on a per project/folder basis, which is usually what you want when working on someone else's open source project.
* Access the function list. ("Goto Symbol...")
    * This can be done in Sublime entirely through the keyboard.

Sublime also has a few features lacking in BBEdit:

* Cross-platform support
    * This is huge when working in a mixed OS environment. You can use the same editor everywhere.

BBEdit still is better in a few areas:

* Can edit preferences in a GUI without mucking about in text files.
* Can quickly split a single file vertically to edit distant sections simultaneously.
* "Zap Gremlins..."
    * Deletes or replaces ASCII control characters and other nasties. Very useful for text pasted from web browsers, Word, or other less-than-pure sources of text.
* "Process Duplicate Lines..."
    * Eliminate duplicate lines in a file. This is often useful after performing a series of text transformations.
* "Process Lines Containing..."
    * Delete (or preserve) all lines containing a subexpression. Exactly like the `grep` command-line tool.
* Can edit files on an FTP/SFTP server directly.
* Customer support I've heard is top-notch.

I think I'm going to continue using Sublime Text. Featurewise it's about the same as BBEdit, but the cross-platform support[^cross-plat], active plugin community, and general polish <!-- & attention to usability --> are winning me over.

[BBEdit]: http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html

[^splunk]: Splunk makes tools for analyzing large time-series datasets, such as log files. For details see the 3 minute [Splunk Product Overview](http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAHG6). I work on the Developer Platform, making it easy for other developers to build neat things on top of the Splunk core.

[^cross-plat]: It is extremely useful to be able to use the same full-featured text editor on any platform I use. I currently maintain a few open source projects that require testing, debugging, and development on multiple platforms (notably the [RDiscount](/projects/rdiscount/) Markdown processor) and it's nice being able to use the same editor everywhere.**p4status** works like `git status` (or `svn status`), but works in Perforce.

It will list changelist files and locally modified files that haven't been added to any changelist (including unadded files) in a readable format.

<div style="padding: .8em 1em .8em; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 1px solid #94da3a;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #487858;">
        Note
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0em;">
        The 2012 version of Perforce has an official
        <b>p4 status</b> command. However this command is only available if 
        your corporate Perforce server has been upgraded to 2012. If your 
        company, like mine, has not upgraded their server, this script will 
        make your life easier.
    </p>
</div>

### Example

<pre>
[dfoster ~/dev/p4/mybranch/path/to/myproject]$ p4status
# On changelist 154055
# 
# Changes to be committed in changelist default:
#   (use "p4 revert <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
# 
#       deleted:    server/apps/setupfx/splunkd/default/extract.conf
# 
# Changes to be committed in changelist 154076:
#   (use "p4 revert <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
# 
#       new file:   server/apps/setupfx/splunkd/default/inputs-NEW.conf
#       modified:   server/apps/setupfx/splunkd/default/inputs.conf
# 
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "p4 add/edit/delete <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "p4 sync -f <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
# 
#       new file:   server/apps/setupfx/splunkd/default/inputs-NEW2.conf
# 
</pre>

### Installation

* Download to your local `bin` directory:
  <https://github.com/davidfstr/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/p4status>
* Mark as executable with `chmod a+x p4status`

### Usage

* `cd` to the primary directory that you'll be working under.
* Run `p4status`.

### Limitations

* Only detects unstaged files under the directory in which the command is run. Therefore it is best to reserve a terminal window that is `cd`-ed to the correct place where this command can be run safely.

* This command is too slow to run from the root of very large branches.

### Alternatives

* Use the excellent Git-to-Perforce bridge, [git-p4].
    * This allows you to work with your Perforce repository as if it were a Git repository. And you can use Git's very fast `git status` command.
* Convince your Perforce server administrator to upgrade to the 2012 version. This may take some time, depending on the size of your company.

[git-p4]: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-p4A *killer app* is any product that is so desirable that it fuels the sale/adoption of a larger technology that the product depends on.

The gaming industry has been aware of the power of killer apps for a while, and often seeks to create launch titles for their new gaming systems that are killer apps. Microsoft, for example, deliberately created the first Halo game at same time as their Xbox console. And Nintendo has repeatedly introduced new Mario titles with its new consoles.

<!-- Similarly, some of the classic examples of killer apps were the first entrants in new software categories: word processors (WordStar) and spreadsheets (VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3). -->

However what may not be so obvious is that killer apps exist for learning new software platforms as well, such as for APIs, SDKs, and programming languages.

Learning a new platform (along with the associated tools and ecosystem) takes a large investment of *time*, and so there is a similar barrier to adoption as, say, the monetary cost of buying a new game console.

I think the platform-builders in the software industry could learn from the gaming industry and strategically introduce killer apps alongside new platform offerings.  I can think of no prior case where this was done deliberately (see the Appendix below), so I think our industry (i.e. software) is really missing out.

[^outlook]: Although Microsoft has finally created a version of Outlook for the Mac, it is buggy and missing a number of advanced features of the Windows version. Thus two of my colleagues <!-- Neeraj and Dee --> who do a lot of planning run Outlook specifically on Windows despite the workplace being otherwise Mac-oriented.Generally [Racket] appears to be a very usable dialect of Lisp/Scheme.

Racket is particularly well suited for those who want to develop their own programming language (including those not based on S-expressions), given that the creators of Racket are programming language researchers. For example, a number of Racket subsets have been created to assist students who are learning Racket/Scheme via the [How to Design Programs] book.[^Racket-subsets] The Arc language by Paul Graham is also implemented in the Racket environment.

Racket's developers wanted to make sure it was a *practical* language. To that end, there is a bundled IDE (DrRacket) with syntax highlighting, parentheses matching, and integrated debugging. There is also a package management system (PLaneT).[^import-planet] And built-in libraries for working with several real-world systems, such as GUIs, networking, databases, JSON/XML, etc. A cross-platform executable can easily be built. And everything is well documented.

Graphics and GUI programs are supported better than the average language. For example pictures are rendered natively in the Racket REPL, including their use within expressions. And the built-in Racket GUI library is fairly decent.

The combination of a decent built-in GUI library along with the ability to compile cross-platform executables makes Racket useful for writing cross-platform GUI applications.

## Racket's GUI library (RacketGUI)

The original version of Racket's GUI library was implemented on top of wxWidgets.[^gui-rewrite] Thus some of wxWidget's poor design decisions leak through:

* A visual component is called a "window", not a control.
* Visual components must be associated with their parent container at creation time.

However, some fixes were made too:

* There is no notion of a wxWidgets "sizer" as distinct from a "container window".
    * This simplifies the mental model considerably, since it is no longer necessary to keep track of both a "window" hierarchy and a sizer hierarchy.
    * Instead, a wxWidgets "sizer" is represented as a lightweight RacketGUI "pane", which can be nested naturally inside containers along with other components.
* The event handling loop is managed in the background automatically.

Sadly, RacketGUI lacks some advanced controls I often want:

* trees
* tables containing controls in cells
    * However the `list-box%` control supports cells that only contain text.
* tree-tables

This is not surprising since these controls are hard to implement and are not well-supported by the original underlying wxWidgets library:

* The wxWidgets tree interface (wxTreeCtrl) is annoying for dynamically generated trees.
* Tables (wxListCtrl) only support text and image cells, not controls as cells.

[^import-planet]: It is possible to import modules directly from the PLaneT repository, which will automatically download and install the module if it isn't already present. Neat!
[How to Design Programs]: http://htdp.org
[^Racket-subsets]: The [HtDP](http://htdp.org) book uses the dialects "Beginning Student", "Intermediate Student", and "Advanced Student". These sublanguages restrict the use of certain language features (such as using functions as objects) and can provide better error messages (which avoid mentioning advanced features not supported by the sublanguage).
[^gui-rewrite]: Racket's GUI layer has apparently been redone a couple of times. Originally it was based on wxWidgets. Later it was rewritten to about 200,000 lines of C++ glue to Xt, Win32, and Carbon. Then in Racket 5.1 it was replaced with about 80,000 lines of Racket glue to Gtk, Win32, Cocoa, Cairo, and Pango. That's a 60% reduction in code! More details on the [Racket blog](http://blog.racket-lang.org/2010/12/racket-version-5.html).## What is Prolog?

Prolog is a declarative programming language that, given a list of axioms and a list of implication rules, can deduce the truth (or falsehood) of a logical statement.

For example, given the following knowledge base (AKA *database*):

<pre>
% Axiom: Mary likes Ted.
likes(mary,ted).
% Axiom: Jane likes Ted.
likes(jane,ted).
% Rule: X is jealous of Y if they both like Z (and are not the same person).
jealous(X,Y) :- likes(X,Z), likes(Y,Z), X \= Y.
</pre>

I can ask the question `jealous(mary,jane)` and get the affirmation `true`.
Or I can ask the question `jealous(mary,mary)` and get the denial `false`.[^period-question]

I can also ask a more complicated question containing variables and Prolog will derive the possible values (and relations) the variables must have in order to make the question posed to be true.

For example, asking the question `jealous(X,Y)` will give the results:

<pre>
X = mary,
Y = jane ;
X = jane,
Y = mary
</pre>

As another (more interesting) example, consider the knowledge base:

<pre>
% Rule: A line is horizontal if its points have the same Y coordinate.
horizontal(line( point(_,Y), point(_,Y) )).
% Rule: A line is vertical if its points have the same X coordinate.
vertical(line( point(X,_), point(X,_) )).
</pre>

And the questions:

<pre>
(1) horizontal(line( point(0,0), point(X,Y) )).  ==>  Y = 0.
(2) horizontal(line( point(0,0), P2 )).          ==>  P2 = point(_G327, 0).
</pre>

The second question is particularly interesting because it gave back a fairly complicated answer: `P2` must be a `point`, its X coordinate can be anything, but its Y coordinate must be zero. I think it's particularly cool that Prolog can deduce that P2 must be a point. <!-- LPN §2.1 -->

As a final example of a simple problem solvable by Prolog, consider the [crossword puzzle] in Exercise 2.4 of "Learn Prolog Now!". You can write a Prolog program to solve crossword puzzles!

[^period-question]: When posing a question in the Prolog interpreter, you must include a trailing period at the end of the question.

## When is Prolog useful?

Prolog's deduction capabilities makes it useful for answering questions and making deductions within systems whose concepts can be expressed in a formal hierarchy. <!-- LPN §2.1 -->

In academia, for example, Prolog has been used to investigate natural language formalizations and expert systems in artificial intelligence. <!-- LPN §2.1 -->

### Case Study: Java bytecode verifier

As a more practical example, Prolog has also been used to define the semantics of the Java bytecode verifier[^java-verifier] for Java 6.[^cite-java-prolog] Prior versions of Java had a verifier whose semantics were defined by a textual specification only (namely the Java Virtual Machine Specification).

There are a few advantages to having the verifier defined in terms of Prolog:

* The specification becomes formal (and thereby unambiguous and more likely to be error-free).
* The execution model for performing the verification becomes well-defined (since it would use Prolog's) and fast (since Prolog's core unification algorithm is fast<!-- LPN §2.1 -->).

[^java-verifier]: The job of the Java bytecode verifier is to examine a compiled Java program and check whether it is well-structured and therefore (reasonably) safe for the Java virtual machine to execute. For example the verifier would reject a Java program containing a command to jump to an instruction location outside of the current method.

[^cite-java-prolog]: See the [Java Virtual Machine Specification](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/index.html). Particularly "Preface to the Java SE 7 Edition" and §4.10 "Verification of class Files".


## Writing Programs

### Functions as Rules

So how do you actually write something resembling a *program* in Prolog? Until now we've been talking about axioms, rules, and questions. But in most languages a program consists of a series of expressions that are evaluated.

For example in Python, you might write:

<pre>
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

print add(5, 3)    # prints 8
</pre>

In Prolog, you can do something similar by defining a rule where one of the variables in the rule (typically the last one) is its "output":

<pre>
add(X, Y, Result) :- Result is X + Y.
</pre>

To actually evaluate this "function" with 5 and 3 you would ask the question `add(5, 3, Result)` which would yield `Result = 8`.

Now, don't get trapped into the idea that such as rule always needs to be evaluated in one direction. In Prolog you have the additional power to ask what the "inputs" of the function has to be to yield an already-known "output".

For example, you could ask the question `add(X, 3, 8)` to deduce that "input" X must be 5.[^is-problems] You could even try asking `add(X, Y, 8)` to find all values of X and Y that yield 8 as a result (although there are an infinite number of such combinations in this example).[^collecting-solutions]

This power to flip functions on their head is a unique quality of Prolog. (And it blows my mind.)

Ultimately a rule specifies a set of relationships between its arguments. Thus arguments can be "inputs", "outputs", or even temporary variables (like accumulators).

[^is-problems]: Unfortunately the `is` clause in this example cannot be run "backwards", so this particular question will fail. (I am not sure why this particular restriction on `is` exists.)

[^collecting-solutions]: A Prolog *program* that wanted to collect all combinations of inputs in this fashion (as opposed to a user at the interpreter) would probably use a combination of the `findall`, `bagof`, and `setof` special rules. See [LPN §11.2 "Collecting Solutions"](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse49) for more information.

### Processing Recursive Data Structures

Processing recursive data structures such as lists and trees is mind bending... For examples see:

* [LPN §6.1 "Append"] and
* [LPN §6.2 "Reversing a List"].

[LPN §6.1 "Append"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse24
[LPN §6.2 "Reversing a List"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse25


## Interactive Use (as a REPL)

It is possible to run Prolog in an interactive fashion by using the `assert` special rule at runtime to define new statements (i.e. axioms and rules). And `listing` will display the set of statements that have been defined. Finally `retract` and `retractall` can be used to undefine statements.

These special rules, however, are not restricted to use in the interpreter - they can also be used at runtime by rules in programs. For example memoization[^memo] is a good use for dynamic calls to `assert`.

[LPN §2.2 "Proof Search"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse6
[LPN §2.4 "Practical Session"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse8

[^memo]: Memoization is where a function that computes a value caches the result of the computation so that repeated invocations with the same input can immediately return the saved result. This can speed of performance in certain applications. See [LPM §11.1 "Database Manipulation"](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse48) for an example.


## Question Evaluation <small>(Unification, Backtracking)</small>

When evaluating a question, Prolog takes the question expression and matches it against the axioms and rules in the input knowledge base. The algorithm used for matching is called *unification*. While performing unification, Prolog makes guesses about what values should be assigned to each variable in the question expression. If it encounters a contradiction, it *backtracks* to one of its previous guesses and revises the guess. This process is described graphically in [LPN §2.2 "Proof Search"].

Although Prolog is a declarative language, the precise behavior of evaluating queries depends on the order that rules and clauses are defined. In particular the performance of the same program can vary significantly depending on ordering. As another gotcha, if you define rules in a left-recursive fashion (as opposed to a right-recursive one), Prolog will go into an infinite loop when evaluating the rule.

It is possible to debug (and step through) the evaluation of a question expression using the **trace** command, which is described in [LPN §2.4 "Practical Session"]. This is useful for investigating performance issues.

### Cuts

It is possible to optimize the execution of a Prolog rule by adding a **cut** as a clause. This is written as a bang (`!`). Unfortunately to use cuts effectively (and correctly), you have to understand the exact execution model used by Prolog. It is quite easy to unwittingly insert a cut that actually changes the semantics of the original rule. <!-- LPN §10.1, §10.2 -->

There are even hacks you can do with cuts such as implementing "negation as failure" (`\+`). But again you have to be very careful since cuts can change your knowledge base's semantics. <!-- LPN §10.3 -->


## Side Effects & I/O

Some built-in clauses trigger side effects when they are examined by the unification algorithm. Programs take advantage of such "impure predicates" to do I/O and other types of side-effecting work.

For example asking the question `print('Hello')` will print `Hello` to the screen.[^str-symbol]

To write to a file you might define:

<pre>
printfile(Filename, Text) :-
    open(Filename, write, Stream),
    write(Stream, Text), nl(Stream),
    close(Stream).
</pre>

And then pose the question `printfile('hogwarts.txt', 'Hogwarts')`.

During evaluation, the `printfile` is rewritten to `open(...) AND write(...) AND nl(...) AND close(...)`. Each of those subclauses is then each evaluated to `true` (performing the associated side effect) and the overall clause becomes just `true`.

[^str-symbol]: Note that `'Hello'` (with single quotes) is a variable, not a string. The string `"Hello"` (with double quotes) is equivalent to a list of codepoints (`[72, 101, 108, 108, 111]`).

<a id="role-of-programming-languages"></a>
## Role of Programming Languages

Languages should:

* provide the means for **combining simple ideas to form complex ideas**,
* provide the means for **abstracting units of computation**, and
* serve as a framework within which we **organize our ideas about processes**.

Units of computation can be abstracted in several forms:

* **procedure** - *Assigns names to common patterns, allowing you to work in terms of the named abstractions directly.*
    * AKA function, method
* **abstract data type** - *Allows the choice of representation (i.e. the implementation) to vary separately from the API (i.e. the interface).*[^impl-vs-interface]
    * Built-in language support is often provided in the form of **classes**.
    * See also: LISP constructors
        * AKA **constructor** or **static factory method** in other languages
    * See also: LISP selectors
        * AKA **accessors**, mutators, or **properties** in other languages
* **module**[^mod-asm] - *Groups several procedures and data types into a namespace independent from other modules.*
    * AKA package (Java), namespace (C++), module (Python)
    * Languages that don't have built-in support for this concept typically use prefixes to create de-facto namespaces. (C, Objective-C, PHP < 5.3.0)
* **assembly** - *Groups several modules together in a single versioned [^versioning] package. Assemblies can depend on other assemblies, often from separate vendors.*
    * AKA **shared library** (C, C++), gem (Ruby), egg (Python)

[^impl-vs-interface]: For example, complex numbers can be expressed in rectangular (a + b*i*) or polar form (r*cos(𝜽)). -- Some representations are better than others for different operations. Adding works better in rectangular form. Multiplying works better in polar form.

[^versioning]: Versioning assemblies effectively is a challenging topic onto itself. If done without care you get so-called "dependency hell". Just getting a consistent version numbering scheme can be tricky. One popular versioning scheme is codified as [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

[^mod-asm]: SICP does not mention the notion of a *module* or an *assembly*, however these are common higher-level units for abstracting computation in languages other than Lisp.

<a id="abstract-data-types"></a>
## Abstract Data Types

<a id="lisp-vs-pascal-design-philosophies"></a>
### Lisp vs. Pascal Design Philosophies

*For you youngin's that have never used Pascal, just replace "Pascal" with "Java" in this section and you should get the right idea.*

Two design philosophies:

* **Lisp-school**: Create abstract data types by combining a *small* set of general-purpose data types (particularly collections). These complex structures can then be manipulated using operations on these general-purpose types.

    * *"Lisp is for building organisms -­ imposing, breathtaking, dynamic structures built by squads fitting fluctuating myriads of simpler organisms into place."*
    
    * *"Lisp programs inflate libraries with functions whose utility transcends the application that produced them."*


* **Pascal-school**: Create *many* special-purpose data types (i.e. classes) and specialized operations to manipulate them.

    * *"Pascal is for building pyramids -­ imposing, breathtaking, static structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place."*
    
    * *"In Pascal the plethora of declarable data structures induces a specialization within functions that inhibits and penalizes casual cooperation."*

Roughly speaking, I think of the Lisp philosophy as **programming with collections** and the Pascal philosophy as **programming with classes**.[^nonviable]

#### Usage

The Pascal philosophy has won out in most statically typed languages such as C++ and Java, and in languages with poor (or nonexistent) built-in collections.

The Lisp philosophy is more common in dynamically typed languages that lack built-in support for classes, such as Lisp itself and JavaScript.

A hybrid approach (using both philosophies) is seen in languages that are dynamically typed, have built-in collections, and have built-in classes, such as Python and Ruby.

[^nonviable]: In my opinion, a language that supports neither first-class collections nor first-class classes is non-viable for large scale general purpose software development. C, Assembly, and Fortran fall into this category.

<a id="polymorphism"></a>
### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is where multiple abstract data types implement a common *interface*, which is typically defined as a series of methods that can be called on all implementing types.

This allows client code, when given an object known only to implement a particular interface, to invoke interface methods on the object and end up calling the correct implementation of that method depending on the runtime type of the object.

#### Implementation Strategies

Polymorphism can be implemented in several different ways:

* **Switch on Typecode**
    * Easiest to implement. Hardest to maintain.
    * Treated as an anti-pattern in many OO languages.
* **Virtual Lookup Tables**
    * AKA "data-directed programming" (in SICP) or v-tables (C++)
    * Default implementation strategy for most OO languages.
* **Message Passing**
    * Most flexible.

Many languages provide a *default implementation strategy* as a language construct. For example C++ and Java use virtual lookup tables. Smalltalk and Objective-C use message passing. C doesn't give you anything for free, so you have to roll your own polymorphism.

#### Tradeoffs

These implementation strategies for polymorphism have some tradeoffs, which are worth knowing:

* Virtual lookup tables are restricted in that *the total set of operations on the abstract data type must be known in advance*.
* Message passing, on the other hand, can be made more flexible: 
    * Implementing data types may choose to support more operations than the standard set on the interface.[^vfs]
    * Heck, individual *instances* can choose to support more operations than the standard set.
        * In such cases, you would want to interrogate (i.e. reflect on) an individual instance to determine what operations (i.e. messages) it understands/supports.

[^vfs]: For example, the Linux virtual filesystem, which is implemented in message-passing style, has a common set of operations that all filesystems are expected to support (ex: `unlink`). However individual filesystems may support additional operations: For example the HFS+ filesystem on Mac OS X additionally supports a `delete` operation, which has slightly different semantics than the standard `unlink` operation.

<a id="cross-type-operations"></a>
### Cross-Type Operations

Introducing **cross-type operations**, such as `add(Integer, Complex)`, is a very tricky design issue.

Having explicit functions that operate on all combinations of types is possible but highly verbose. With **n** types and **m** operations, you need <strong>n*m</strong> functions to implement all combinations. Impractical.

Another strategy is to use *coercion* to convert a value from one type to another. So instead of defining `add(Integer, Complex)`, just define `convertToComplex(Integer) : Complex`, and use the existing `add(Complex, Complex)`. To convert between all types requires at least **n** but no more than **n<sup>2</sup>** conversion functions.

Many programming languages have built-in facilities to automatically coerce types. For some languages (like JavaScript or PHP) these coersion rules are quite complex (and error-prone). Other languages (like ML) ban implicit coercion entirely.

* Java only has coercion for built-in types.
* C++ lets the datatype designer choose (via `implicit` or explicit one-argument constructors).
* Scala relies on implicit coercion a lot to enable foreign methods to be introduced on types.

One wrinkle is that these conversion functions might introduce a loss in precision. For example not every integer can be represented as double of exactly the same value.

<a id="assignments-mutable-state-and-side-effects"></a>
## Assignments, Mutable State, and Side Effects

Introducing assignment creates lots of complications. In particular *referential transparency* is lost. Optimizations related to reordering and coalescing expressions need to be a lot more careful. Static reasoning of various kinds is impaired.

To reduce bugs it is best to minimize the use of mutation by using immutable objects whenever possible.[^large-structs]

Haskell takes a very aggressive stance against assignments, mutable state, and other side effects: they are banned by default. However Haskell does allow side effects within the context of a **monad**. This is a special construct unique to Haskell (so far as I know).

[^large-structs]: A common case where eliminating mutation may *not* be practical is when defining and working with large data structures that need many small updates made to them over time. If such a structure were made immutable, there would be a large performance penalty for recopying the entire structure whenever a small change needed to be made.

<a id="lazy-evaluation"></a>
### Lazy Evaluation

Normally expressions are evaluated immediately, in the order that they occur in code. **Lazy evaluation** changes this behavior such that expressions are only evaluated when some primitive operation (like print or add) requires the value of the expression. Until then the unevaluated expression is passed around (as a "thunk").

Lazy evaluation enables that creation of **lazy data structures**, which is a useful performance optimization in some contexts.

Unrestricted mutation and lazy evaluation do not mix well in programming languages. Since unrestricted mutation is very common in mainstream programming languages, it is quite rare to be in an environment that supports lazy evaluation. Haskell is one of the few.

<a id="declarative-languages"></a>
## Declarative Languages

Logic programming languages are at the far declarative end of the
imperative-declarative spectrum. They can be used to deduce answers
from a set of initial set of declarative statements.

[Prolog] is the best-known example of a logic programming language.

Query systems for databases are a type of logic programming language.

A "query" (i.e. an expression in the language) is transformed into a
"query plan" (i.e. a specific set of steps to follow) by a query planner. The implemented of these planners is quite complex.

[Prolog]: /articles/2013/02/25/notes-on-prolog/

<a id="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion

So those are a few interesting things I learned from reading SICP. Taking notes while reading made it a lot easier for me to remember the content. You might try it when reading a technical book with a lot of new concepts.

I like learning new languages to get myself to think about problems in different ways.

Here's a list of a few well-known languages I've worked with and some of the more interesting features I've encountered:

### C

* **Undefined behavior**
    * The idea that a language specification would explicitly specify certain constructs as having undefined behavior is interesting. Most specifications leave things undefined by omission, not commission.
    * Although this allows various compiler optimizations, many developers rely on their particular compiler's implementation of undefined behavior without even realizing it.[^overflow]

[^overflow]: For example it is undefined what happens when you add to an integer variable and the variable overflows. In most compilers adding 1 to the largest integer wraps around to result in the smallest integer, and thus a number of programs depend on this behavior. Other compilers [assume overflow is impossible](http://thiemonagel.de/2010/01/signed-integer-overflow/).

### Java

* **Objects are the primary unit of composition**
    * There are no standalone functions.
    * Design Patterns can be used to describe high level object coordination patterns.
    * However sometimes the community's focus on objects can be a bit extreme[^java-rant].
* **Checked exceptions**
    * Great when used *sparingly*, as it forces the caller to handle expected error conditions.    
        * I do think that it was a usability error to make `Exception` checked and `RuntimeException` unchecked. Rather it should be `Exception` that is *unchecked* and a new `CheckedException` should be the base for all checked exceptions. This makes it clear that *unchecked* exceptions should be the default.
    * Managing checked exceptions *correctly* is quite difficult. <!-- TODO: ARTICLE-IDEA -->
* **Unicode strings**
    * Tons of other languages use "bytestrings" as the main string type which causes all kinds of problems when working with international characters. <!-- TODO: ARTICLE-IDEA -->
* **Documentation focus**
    * Every library is expected to have JavaDoc documentation, which is generated from documentation comments in the source
    * This is really powerful, since it makes it easy for developers to write documentation, and to do so at the same time the implementation is coded, when the desired behavior is most fresh in the mind.
* **Compatibility focus**
    * I have never seen a community so focused on maintaining backward compatibility. I can't think of a single deprecated method in the Java library that was actually deleted.
    * Even the Java Language Specification has an entire chapter devoted to [binary compatibility](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/binaryComp.html).
    * This focus may be partially attributable to the early mantra of [Write once, run anywhere][wora].
* **Garbage Collection**
    * Being freed from the confines of manual memory management makes it a ton easier to focus on more important things.

[^java-rant]: Steve Yegge has a great rant on the over-focus on objects in the Java community: [Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html)

[wora]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere

### C&#35;

Very similar to Java.[^java-copycat]

* **Assemblies**
    * This is a level of encapsulation above the typical namespaces or modules in most languages. Assemblies are similar to the idea of static/dynamic libraries in C or JAR files in Java.
    * Notably, you can mark members as `internal`, which makes them public within the same assembly, but private to everybody outside the assembly. This is quite useful.
* **Cross-language compatibility is first-class** (not just for C)
    * C# runs in the Common Language Runtime, which was designed from the beginning to support interoperability between languages.
* **Properties are first-class**
    * No longer need to write explicit getter and (optional) setter methods.
* **Listeners are first-class**
    * Classes can declare an *event* `Foo` with `addFooListener` and `removeFooListener` functionality built in.
    * Unfortunately the implementation has some annoyances[^event-flaw].
* **Foreign Methods[^foreign-method] are first-class**
    * C# calls these *extension methods*.
* **Partial Classes**
    * Allows a class's members to be defined in multiple files.
    * Useful to add functionality to a generated class (for example, from a parser generator) without those modifications getting lost when the class is next regenerated.

[^java-copycat]: C# is by design almost a direct copy of Java. It amazes me that Microsoft (C#'s sponsor) would spend so much effort making a copy of an existing language.

[^foreign-method]: I am referring to the [Foreign Method](http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/introduceForeignMethod.html) design pattern here, not a native function from a [foreign function interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface).

[^event-flaw]: If you invoke an uninitialized event-property, it will throw a `NullReferenceException` instead of ignoring your request, as you would expect. Workaround by initializing events with an empty delegate.

### Python

* **Indentation is significant**
    * Everyone notices this pretty fast.
    * Overall I think requiring correct indentation is a Good Thing™, as it contributes directly to *readable* code.
    * However this makes lambda expressions much less powerful than in other languages, since you can't easily nest statements inside a lambda expression without explicit braces (or similar delimiters).
    * Another side effect of having significant indentation is that the choice of tabs vs. spaces really matters. If you mix them, your program probably won't run.
* **Interactive interpreter (REPL)**
    * Amazingly useful for prototyping quickly, running experiments, and learning the language.
* **Collections are first class**
    * You can type `[1,2,3]` to get a list, `{'key': 'value'}` to get a dictionary, and `{1,2,3}` to get a set. So much faster than `new ArrayList<Integer>(...)`, `new HashMap<Integer>(...)`, or `new HashSet<Integer>(...)`.
* **Functions are first class**
    * You can declare them as literals, pass them around, and create higher-order functions that take functions as parameters.
    * Functions can also live on their own without an enclosing class, in contrast to Java. This is often the simplest approach for a given implementation.
* **"Magic" marked explicitly**
    * Anything "magic" that the language treats specially has names surrounded by double underscores.
    * For example:
        * An object's constructor is called `__init__`.
        * The method implementing an operator overload for plus is called `__add__`.
        * A class's metaclass is held by the `__metaclass__` field.
* **Generators** and **Coroutines**
    * Generators enable straightforward *pulling* of values from a complex data source (like a parsed data structure).
    * Coroutines enable straightforward *pushing* of values to a complex data sink.
    * Python calls both constructs a *generator*.

### JavaScript

* **No blocking I/O**
    * All I/O is non-blocking and asynchronous. This results in heavy use of [continuation passing style].
* **Successful despite huge flaws**
    * Ease of deployment and ubiquity (i.e. business considerations) trump ease of use. (PHP also wins for the same reason.)
    * A few flaws:
        * Everything is in the one global namespace.
        * No user-defined namespaces, modules, or importing of other files.[^js-no-namespaces]
        * No built-in facility for classes.[^js-no-classes]
        * Bizarre loose semantics for `==`.[^js-equality]
        * Multiple illegal value sentinels: `null` and `undefined`.[^js-truthy]
* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
    * A fantastically compact, readable, and portable notation for representing all kinds of data structures. Great for data interchange.

[continuation passing style]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style

[^js-no-namespaces]: Hence workarounds like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) to get includes and modules.

[^js-no-classes]: Hence reimplementions of class semantics in libraries like MooTools, Prototype, and [random blog posts](http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/). (That blog post has the best implementation, IMHO.)

[^js-equality]: Hence recommendations to always use `===` instead of `==`.

[^js-truthy]: Hence recommendations to only depend on the "truthy" and "falsy" values of expressions instead of direct comparisons with `null` or `undefined`.

### Haskell

* **Lazy evaluation**
    * Expressions are only evaluated when some primitive operation (like `print` or `add`) requires the value of the expression.
    * Allows you to define your own control flow operators.[^control-flow]
    * Allows you to extract complex expressions without fear of introducing a performance hit (since the expression will only actually be evaluated if it is needed).
* **Side effects banned by default**
    * Mutation of data structures and I/O, both of which have order-sensitive side effects, are not allowed except within the confines of **monad**.
    * A **monad** is a construct that explicitly controls evaluation order, in contrast to the usual unpredictable lazy evaluation behavior.
* **`null` banned by default.**
    * Unlike many languages, there is no special `null` value in Haskell that can be substituted anywhere.
    * Instead if a function wants to return a value of type `T` or null, you would declare the function as returning type `Option<T>`, which could either have the value `Some(tValue)` or `None`. When declared in this way, callers are *required* to handle both possibilies.
* **Type inference (+ static typing)**
    * The benefits of static typing without the need to specify the types for everything?  
      Count me in!

[^control-flow]: Want to implement Ruby's `until` loop or `unless` conditional? No problem.

### Lisp <small>(Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure)[^lisp-dialects]</small>

* **Homoiconic**
    * When you write a Lisp program, the notation you use (the *grammar*) is equivalent to what a compiler would see (an *abstract syntax tree* or *AST*).
    * Furthermore this Lisp code is represented as a nested structure of lists, symbols, and literals, all of which can be directly generated and manipulated in Lisp itself!
    * This allows Lisp code to generate list structures which can then be run as Lisp code directly.
        * Generation can be done at *compile* time with **macros**.
        * Generation can be done at *runtime* as well, and then invoked with **eval**.
    * However the highly uniform structure of Lisp code, devoid of operator and syntactic diversity, makes for lousy typography and thus low readability.
* **Macros**
    * A function that transforms the AST of its operands at *compile* time to new code.
    * Macros can be used to generate arbitrary new statements and control structures.
        * Domain specific languages, in particular, are very easy to implement in Lisp thanks to macros.
    * Macros can also be used to perform code optimizations at compile time[^macro-optimize] (similar to  "template metaprogramming" in C++).
    * Fluent use of macros requires the host language to be homoiconic, which is rare. Thus Lisp remains the only well-known language family that has macros.
* **Lisp Conditions and Restarts**
    * Allows bidirectional communication between different parts of the call stack. More powerful than exceptions, since conditions can not only unwind the stack but also wind it back again via a restart.
* **Call-with-current-continuation**
    * Allows you to save the current execution state of the program in a variable and jump back to it later. Multiple times, even. It's like a friggin' time machine. You can implement fairly complex control flow operators with this function.

[^lisp-dialects]: There are more dialects of Lisp than any other language I can think of. These 3 (Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure) are just the most popular dialects. I've directly used [Racket](/articles/2013/03/01/notes-on-racket/) in the past, which is itself a dialect of Scheme.

[^macro-optimize]: Prismatic performs efficient [compile-time DOM templating](http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2013/1/22/the-magic-of-macros-lighting-fast-templating-in-clojurescript) in ClojureScript using macros.

### Other

* **Fexprs**
    * A function whose operands are passed to it at runtime without being evaluated.
    * Similar to macros and lazy evaluation in terms of power.
    * Has fallen out of favor since the 1980s due to being difficult for compilers to optimize. Also it is hard to provide good error messages.
    * Furthermore most fexpr functions tend to rely on *eval* to continue evaluating its operands. The use of *eval* has its own problems...

</ul>
</li>
<li>Your <em>behaviors</em> should support your goals.</li>
<li>Expect your goals to change. Success is dynamic.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t let <em>others</em> define success for you.</li>
<li>You can get rich by getting more or <em>wanting less</em>.</li>
<li>Life is one great balancing act.

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s no single right way of doing things.</li>
<li>Balancing your priorities and goals is important.</li>
</ul>

<p>I love programming. It tickles me when I stumble across a new programming language that lets me express concepts in a more clear and direct fashion. I love the cleanness and order that results after a good round of refactoring<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I enjoy the challenge of hacking away at a fiddly problem and testing all the cases to get a correct and bulletproof solution.</p>

<p>However I have realized programming is merely an activity. It is a <em>means</em>, not an <em>end</em>. My work is not inherently valuable because I have created a piece of software. Rather it is because I have created software <em>that solves somebody&rsquo;s problem</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Therefore it is the <em>problem</em> that deserves the most attention if you want to make a difference that people care about. In that vein I have been learning about the precepts of Customer Development and Customer Discovery, which deals with how to efficiently interact with customers to discover a problem that they care about.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Direct customer interaction, such as through in-person interviews of the general public, is way outside my comfort zone. However I will persevere. I think it is a very important skill for actually making a dent in the universe.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p><em><b>TLDR:</b> Drupal is overly complex for a personal blog. It is hard to maintain. Simple static site generators are easier to work with in the long term.</em></p>

<p>My portfolio website was written during college using hand-coded HTML and used server-side includes to bring in common navigation.</p>

<p>Then in January 2010 I remade my site in Drupal. It gained lots of fancy features such as first-class support for project categories and project languages. You could subscribe to almost any page as a feed. There were project specific updates that could be commented on. From a feature point of view, it rocked.</p>

<p>But some problems became apparent over time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security updates were frequent and difficult to apply correctly.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t like writing articles on the site because I couldn&rsquo;t use simple markup formats such as Markdown.

<ul>
<li>Drupal has no good editor plugins for markup languages.</li>
<li>And its visual HTML editor generates messy HTML.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The theme I used for the site was complex and hard to modify.

<ul>
<li>And the CSS often interfered with my article markup, necessitating me to drop into HTML when editing certain articles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There was no sane way to test structural changes to the site locally and then automatically deploy them to production.

<ul>
<li>Normally this would be done by keeping the site structure in the filesystem and all user content in a database. This allows the filesystem contents to be easily deployed using <code>git push</code>, <code>rsync</code>, or similar techniques.</li>
<li>Drupal, by contrast, keeps its site structure in both the filesystem <em>and</em> in the database, along with user-generated content. Updating only the parts of the database related to site structure is cumbersome and error-prone.</li>
<li>Thus, I couldn&rsquo;t really change the site structure after my initial deployment to production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nothing was in revision control, which made me nervous.</li>
<li>I had to hack the Drupal core to get my contact form to work with my web hosting provider.</li>
<li>Most of the features of the site weren&rsquo;t being used by readers.</li>
</ul>


<p>So now I am rewriting my site yet again in straight HTML (via a simple static site generator) and outsourcing all user generated content (like comments) to third party service providers.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple simple simple.</li>
<li>Automatic security. The web server just serves static files.</li>
<li>Automatic scalability, for the same reason.</li>
<li>Simple authoring in Markdown with powerful client-side text editors.</li>
<li>Instant deployment with <code>git push</code>.</li>
<li>Everything in revision control.</li>
<li>I can use any web hosting provider. Hell, I can just use <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> for free.</li>
<li>Ultimate control over the site theme and CSS. I can fix problems myself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The old Retrospect 6.0</h2>

<p>In the past I have used Retrospect 6.0 to backup my Macs, since it was one of
the few programs that reliably backed up everything correctly, with all the
metadata intact. But it is looking much less attractive these days&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It no longer finds my laptop on the network reliably, due to some bug.
Especially when switching between wireless and wired networks.
Thus I often miss backups.</p></li>
<li><p>It is slow.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not groom backups.</p></li>
<li><p>It stores everything inside a single monolithic file,
which is at risk of corruption.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The new Retrospect 8.0</h2>

<p>The latest version of Retropect (8.0) is somewhat better but has some problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It does not seem to backup all attributes correctly.
For example, volume icons do not seem to be restored correctly.
Inaccurate backups are useless.</p></li>
<li><p>It is more complicated to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic grooming, although supported, is so slow to be practically unusable.
It takes maybe 2x as long to do one grooming operation as an incremental backup.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Time Machine</h2>

<p>Now there is Time Machine. Since my primary systems are 10.5+, I can use it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It <em>should</em> support reliable backup of all filesystem attributes,
since it was made by Apple, who is in a position to know about them.
Also, Apple typically makes solid products.</p></li>
<li><p>It has quick, automatic, incremental backups.</p></li>
<li><p>It also grooms automatically while it is backing up. Grooming behavior is
intelligent, keeping snapshots at sensible intervals.</p></li>
<li><p>The single-file restore interface is precise, intuitive, and fast.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Only wrinkle is that Time Machine is not really designed to backup to network
drives, however there are <a href="http://code.stephenmorley.org/articles/time-machine-on-a-network-drive/">instructions for circumventing this</a>.
(Of course there is Time Machine + Time Capsule for network backups, but a
Capsule is egregiously expensive.)</p>

<h3>2012 Update</h3>

<p>Time Machine misses a few filesystem attributes that Retrospect 6.0 nailed back
in the day, like volume icons.</p>

<p>I think it may also strip HFS+ extended attributes, since applications appear
to be quarantined after they are restored from a Time Machine backup.</p>

<p>One last nitpick is that TM has very poor handling for bad media and bad blocks.
In particular if your primary hard drive develops bad blocks, which is an early
sign of imminent failure, Time Machine will choke and refuse to backup the
entire volume. And this is exactly at the time you need it your files backed up
the most, when your hard drive is likely to fail.</p>

## Copyrights

The first time that a piece of software is published, whether it be in binary or source form, it automatically gains copyright status. This is true even if you don't include the magic words `Copyright (c) 2013 David Foster`.[^magic_words]

[^magic_words]: However if you *do* include the magic words `Copyright (c) 2013 David Foster` it is easier to demonstrate *willful* infringement when you sue someone for infringing your copyright. Willful infringment entitles the copyright owner to higher *damages* (i.e. payments from the infringer) than vanilla infringement.

### Copyright grants the author certain exclusive rights.

That is, other people don't get these rights. Such rights include (but are not limited to):

* The right to *distribute* the software, even for free.
* The right to *sell* the software.

But then you might ask how download sites like Download.com can operate: If by default only the original author has the right to distribute the software they create, a download site would need to get special permission (i.e. a *license*) to distribute most programs on their site, which would be time consuming (and therefore expensive).

In reality, download sites generally rely on software authors to not *enforce* their copyrights. Which brings us to another point:

### Copyrights are useless unless they are enforced.

Enforcement takes the form of the copyright holder actively looking for *infringers*: other people who are distributing or selling the software without permission.

For example, the MPAA may issue a DMCA takedown request to a YouTube user who has (without permission) posted an episode of a TV show that MPAA owns. If the user does not comply with the takedown, the MPAA may sue the user for infringement.

## Licenses

### A copyright holder may waive or share some rights by issuing a *license*.

Licenses may be issued to individuals or companies. For example  a particular distributor may be granted the right to market and sell the software on behalf of the original developer.[^app_store]

For open source software, licenses are typically granted to the community as a whole (i.e. every recipient of the program). This is typically done by including a file called `LICENSE` or `COPYING` with the software. A license may also be found in the software's `README`.

You can write your own custom license (if you feel comfortable writing in legalese). Or you can use one of the more common existing licenses from the community. (See [Common Licenses](#common_licenses) below for a list.)

[^app_store]: If you sell any apps on the App Store, you signed an agreement giving Apple such marketing rights.

### Dual Licensing

Sometimes the same piece of software is offered under multiple licenses.

For example the Qt GUI toolkit has been available under both the GPL license and (with payment) a commercial closed-source license for a long time. Since companies don't like basing their own closed source software on GPL-licensed original software, this gives them an option to use a more corporate-friendly commercial license.

When creating a new piece of software that is based on or uses dual-licensed software, you should document which license the original software is being used under.

If you are the original author of a piece of software, you can issue a new version of the software under additional licenses.

### Changing a Software's License

Under rare circumstances, the license provided with software can change.

As the copyright holder of a piece of software, you may decide to release a new version with a different set of licenses than prior versions. For example you could change the license offered from [BSD](#bsd) to [GPL](#gpl), a rather radical change. Such a change would only be in effect for the newly released version - it would have no effect on older released versions.

If you are not the copyright holder of a piece of software, you cannot change the license(s) under which it is offered.

If there are contributors beyond the original author whose changes have been incorporated into the software, they become partial copyright holders in the software as well unless they explicitly waive their copyright interests via a Contributor Agreeement or similar document. In the event of multiple copyright holders, all holders must agree to any proposed changes in the set of licenses under which the software is offered. Since there may be a large number of contributors (and thus copyright holders), it may be impossible to get permission from everyone, thereby making a license change infeasible.

Projects that are particularly aware of copyright concerns may require all contributors to sign a Contributor Agreement that either waives all copyright interests or explicitly assigns the copyright associated with all contributions to the original author.[^splunk_assignment]

[^splunk_assignment]: For example my present company Splunk requires that all contributors to its open source projects sign a Contributor Agreement of this type.

### No Warranty

All software licenses I have seen explicitly disclaim all warranties. Meaning that if the software harms someone, you can't sue the developer for it. This is great for software developers but in my opinion bad for society.

### Common Licenses

Here are the most common open source licenses, arranged generally from most permissive to most restrictive.

If you don't care about the details and only want to know when to use which license, skip to the [summary](#license_summary).

<a name="mit"></a>
#### Public Domain[^pub_domain] <small>&mdash; ultimately permissive</small>

* Do whatever you want with this software.
* This software cannot ever be placed under copyright or any license.

[^pub_domain]: Technically the state of being in the "public domain" is not a license. Any work explicitly released into the public domain is not subject to copyright law at all. In particular there is no copyright holder and can never be a copyright holder in the future.

<a name="mit"></a>
#### MIT License <small>&mdash; super permissive, simple</small>

* Do whatever you want with this software.

<a name="bsd"></a>
#### BSD License <small>&mdash; permissive, simple</small>

* You can redistribute this software.
* (Other rights are not expressedly waived.)
* There are several [variants](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BSD_licenses&oldid=539421860) of this license.

<a name="apache"></a>
#### Apache 2.0 License <small>&mdash; permissive, complex</small>

* You can do anything normally restricted by copyright.
* You can do anything normally restricted by patent rights.
* Redistribution must be done under certain terms.
* Submissions by contributors automatically fall under
  this license unless specified otherwise.
* You may NOT use trademarks related to this software
  (except in a few special cases).

<a name="lgpl"></a>
#### LGPL License 2.1 <small>&mdash; restrictive, complex</small>

* You can redistribute this software.
* You can modify this software and distribute the derived work. However the derived work must also be LGPL-licensed.
* You can relicense a copy of this software under the GPL. (This is an irreversible action for works derived from the new copy.)
* If you create your own software that uses this LGPL-software, the license of your source code is unaffected. However the resulting *executable* and (sometimes) the *object code* must satisfy the following terms:
    * Modification of the executable and object code is permitted for personal use.
    * Reverse engineering of the executable and object code is permitted.
    * You must give notice that the executable and object code uses this software and that this software is licensed under the LGPL. You must also provide a copy of the LGPL license text.
    * If the software displays copyright notices during its operation (such as in an About box), the LGPL copyright notice for this software must be included and a reference to the full LGPL license text must be provided.
    * Either:
        * (1) Include the source code for this software (including any modifications you made to it) when distributing the executable and object code.
        * (2) Require that the user of the executable or object code have this software installed locally already, and use shared library mechanisms to link the executable against the (unmodified) local copy of this software.
    * If distributing an executable, the nondistributed form of your software must include any data or utility programs necessary to compile the executable.[^include_utility_programs]

[^include_utility_programs]: At face value this doesn't actually seem like a restriction. However the LGPL text cautions, "It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute."

<a name="gpl"></a>
#### GPL License 2.0 <small>&mdash; restrictive, complex, "viral"</small>

* You can redistribute the source code of this software.
* You can modify this software and distribute the derived work.  However the derived work must also be GPL-licensed.[^gpl_ambiguous_derived]
* You can distribute this software or any software you create based on it, in executable or object code form, provided that you also distribute the corresponding source code (or provide a written offer to do so).

[^gpl_ambiguous_derived]: The GPL is ambiguous with respect to whether a piece of software that you create based on the GPL-licensed software (including merely linking to it) should be considered a derivative work or not. If so, then the GPL is truly "viral": any piece of code that interfaces with GPL-licensed software must also be licensed under the GPL. If not, the GPL still specifies unambiguously that programs based on GPL-licensed software must be distributed with all accompanying source code. Neither proposition is tolerable for most corporate software entities.

#### No License <small>&mdash; ultimately restrictive</small>

* You cannot redistribute or sell this software.
* You cannot create new software that is based on this software (i.e. derivative works).

<a name="license_summary"></a>
### Choosing a License

It is best to pick the license whose terms convey the message you want to send:

* **Public Domain**
    * Do anything you want with this software. It is free forever.
* **MIT**
    * Do anything you want with this software. (Although I might change my mind later.)
* **BSD (4-clause)**
    * Do anything you want with this software, although I want to be attributed (i.e. mentioned as the original author). But I don't want my name used to promote other things.
* **Apache**
    * You can do most things with this software.  
      (And my lawyers want a precise definition of what "most things" means.)
* **LGPL**
    * I want the source code for this software library (and any derived software) to be freely available forever. I also want to enforce that all improvements to this software library that are incorporated into other products be available for independent inspection.
    * I don't care if these extra terms made it burdensome for commercial entities to use my library, although I would like to make it possible for them to still use it if desired.
* **GPL**
    * I want the source code for this software library and any external software that uses it to be freely available forever.
    * I don't care if this means that my software will never be incorporated into a commercial product.
* **Copyright Notice; No License**
    * Don't even think about incorporating this software into another product, or selling it.
* **No Copyright Notice; No License**
    * I don't know about copyright or licenses. Ask me if you want to do something with my software.

Now that I've figured all of this out, it's time to update the licenses I'm using for [my own open source projects](https://github.com/davidfstr?tab=repositories).
Last week I decided to update one of my larger Python 2.7 projects to support Unicode fully
and to run under Python 3.

Here are the steps that I took and some gotchas I ran into along the way.

## General Strategy

Create and fully automate the unit test suite:

* This is important to detect any unexpected breakage from the Unicode-related changes you'll be making soon.
* Make sure your code coverage is good since tests can't protect you from mistakes introduced in uncovered code.

Identify all boundaries where data is being exchanged between the program and the outside environment. In my case:

* Direct I/O (i.e. `read` and `write`)
* Filesystem access (i.e. `open` and file paths)
* Process manipulation (via the `subprocess` module)
* Command-line arguments (via `sys.argv`)
* Time access (via the `time` module)

At boundaries:

* Reads should decode bytestrings to unicode using the proper encoding. You may need to do research to determine what the correct encoding is or how to determine the correct encoding at runtime.
    * Since my program did a lot of direct I/O on classic Mac OS data structures, the correct encoding was typically MacRoman.
    * `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` is sometimes appropriate. Be sure to test on Windows, where this value is typically not UTF-8.
* Writes should encode unicode (or ASCII bytestring literals) to bytestrings using the proper encoding.
* Ensure files and streams explicitly use either binary mode (i.e. `rb` or `wb`) or text mode (i.e. `rt` or `wt`).
    * UsuBytesIOally you want binary mode.
    * Text mode is required for certain cases, such as the output of the `json` module. Even then, it's a good idea to restrict text-based output to the ASCII character set since the native text encoding may not support the full Unicode set, particularly on Windows.

Finally:

* Run the `2to3` converter on your program so that it can be run by Python 3. 
* Run your new Python 3 source code in a Python 3 interpreter, perhaps inside a fresh Linux VM.
* Run your test suite under the Python 3 interpreter. It should find any Unicode mistakes that still need to be fixed.
* You will probably need to repeat this convert-test-fix cycle a couple of times.

## Special Cases

* Most uses of `StringIO` need to be migrated to `BytesIO`, when used as a byte buffer. If used as a string buffer, the `StringIO` uses need to be left at `StringIO`.
    * Here's the shim I used to support `BytesIO` and `StringIO` in both Python 2 and 3. I put it in a utility module and the rest of the program imports the shims instead of using the standard library.

<pre>
# BytesIO presents a stream interface to an in-memory bytestring.
# 
# This is equivalent to StringIO in Python 2 and to BytesIO in Python 3.
try:
    from io import BytesIO              # Python 3
except ImportError:
    from StringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

# StringIO presents a stream interface to an in-memory string
# (which is a bytestring in Python 2 and a unicode string in Python 3).
# 
# This is equivalent to StringIO in both Python 2 and 3.
try:
    from StringIO import StringIO
except ImportError:
    from io import StringIO             # Python 3
</pre>

* When writing to a binary stream, replace uses of `output.write(chr(byte_ordinal))` with `output.write(bchr(byte_ordinal))` and use the following shim for `bchr`:

<pre>
# bchr() converts the specified byte integer value to a single character
# bytestring.
# 
# This is equivalent to chr() in Python 2 but requires special handling in
# Python 3.
if bytes == str:
    def bchr(byte_ordinal):
        return chr(byte_ordinal)
else:
    def bchr(byte_ordinal):
        return bytes([byte_ordinal])    # Python 3
</pre>

* Beware of comparisons with `''`. Some of them probably need to be converted to comparisons with `b''`. For example, I had to adjust my `at_eof` utility function:

<pre>
def at_eof(input):
    """
    Returns whether the specified input stream is at EOF.
    """
    with save_stream_position(input):
        at_eof = input.read(1) == b''
    return at_eof
</pre>

* If your program uses human-readable ASCII bytestring literals, such as FourCC codes, make sure they are marked with the `b` prefix appropriately.

<pre>
if type_code == b'APPL':
</pre>

* Iteration over bytestrings works differently in Python 2 vs Python 3.
    * The code `for c in data:` will give back single-character bytestrings in Python 2 but byte ordinals in Python 3.
    * Here's my shim to let `for b in iterord(data):` always iterate over byte ordinals:

<pre>
# iterord() iterates over the integer values of the bytes in the specified
# bytestring.
if bytes == str:
    def iterord(bytes_value):           # Python 2
        for b in bytes_value:
            yield ord(b)
else:
    def iterord(bytes_value):           # Python 3
        return bytes_value
</pre>

* `time.strftime` returns a bytestring in Python 2 and a Unicode string in Python 3. Usually you want a Unicode string. I didn't create a shim for this since I only had one use of `strftime`.

<pre>
now_string = time.strftime('%b %d %H:%M', time.localtime(now))
if not isinstance(now_string, unicode):
    now_string = now_string.decode('ascii')
</pre>

* Regular expressions that are intended to apply to bytestrings instead of Unicode strings may need updating.
    * For example the pattern `re.compile(r'^Volume name is "(.*)"$')` which is designed to be applied to a MacRoman-encoded bytestring would need to be updated to read `re.compile(br'^Volume name is "(.*)"$')`

* Don't forget to update your documentation to specify where Unicode (or ASCII bytestring literals) are expected.It has been said that you can learn a lot from reading other people's high-quality software. So I gave it a try this weekend by reading the SQLite source.

SQLite is a lightweight embedded database that does not require a standalone server. It is designed to be reliable, highly portable, and require minimal administration.

SQLite has some of the [most rigorous testing methodology] I have seen in an open source project. Thus its true defect count is likely to be extremely low, making it high quality.

Such a high quality product probably contains useful patterns and techniques, some of which I could reuse in my own programs. So I decided to dive into the SQLite source and see what gems I could pull out. Here are my notes:

[most rigorous testing methodology]: https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html

## Architecture & Design

I started by reading the high-level design documentation. SQLite has exceptionally good documentation of this type.

* [Documentation Index] - *Root of all documentation.*

* [Architecture Documentation] - *Excellent overview of the architecture.*

* Query Planner Documentation - *Describes how prepared statements are executed.*
    * [The Virtual Database Engine]
    * [Virtual Machine Opcodes]

### Internal Tools of Note

#### [Fossil]

Distributed version control system used by SQLite. I've never heard of this. Beyond version control also provides bug tracking, a wiki, and a blog.

#### [Lemon]

A custom parser generator used by SQLite. Alternative to the old bison/yacc combination which has some improvements:

* Syntax that is less error-prone.
* Fast. Reentrant. Thread-safe.
* Easier to write parsers that avoid leaking memory upon error conditions.
    * Important since SQLite is serious about handling out of memory conditions.

#### [VFS]

OS abstraction layer. Despite the acronym (Virtual Filesystem), it is more than just filesystem manipulation routines.

## Implementation Notes

### table.c (sqlite3_get_table)

* This is the main entry point into the SQLite API.
  It executes a SQL statement and returns the result.

* First impression is that most methods have a lot of malloc-failed handling. And indeed if you read the testing procedures, they involve causing random malloc errors throughout the code, so there has to be handling for such errors.

* Hungarion notation is used as well. Ick. But at least it is consistent.
    * z = string
    * a = array
    * p = object pointer
    * n = int
    * x = function pointer

* `/* Assume 32-bit assignment is atomic */`
    * Interesting that such a property would be *consciously* relied on.

### legacy.c (sqlite3_exec)

* This is the legacy entry point into the SQLite API.
  It still exists and is actually used internally by the currently
  recommended API entry point (`sqlite3_get_table`).

* There are some odd syntactic conventions.
    * Multi-line comments use double-stars to prefix middle lines.
    * No space before closing `{`.
    * Spaces inside outer parentheses for most statements
      (`if`, `while`, `assert`) but not all (`for`).

* It appears that functions that begin with `sqlite3_` are public,
  whereas functions starting with `sqlite3` (no underscore) are private.


### vdbeapi.c (sqlite3_step)

* This function executes one or more instructions from the instruction list
  inside of a prepared SQL statement. The instruction is executed inside
  of the SQLite virtual database engine (VDBE), which is a virtual machine.
    * It has a lot of support code for EXPLAIN and profiling callbacks.
    * The meat of instruction execution is done by `sqlite3VdbeExec`.

* Contains own mutex implementation. (`sqlite3_mutex_enter`)

* Deals with a somewhat crazy circumstance: If the database schema changes
  in the middle of executing a (prepared) SQL statement, the statement is
  reprepared and rerun automatically.

* Generally there is good commenting for weird and backward-compatibility
  behaviors.

* Practically every function can fail. They all return an integer error code.
    * Some functions that operate on an in-out data structure will
      additionally store an error code (and message) in that structure.

### vdbe.c (sqlite3VdbeExec)

* This function executes as many instructions as possible from a prepared
  SQL statement. It contains the monsterous switch statement that 
  enumerates every possible opcode that can be executed.
    * Related reference documentation: [Virtual Machine Opcodes]
    * Related guide documentation: [The Virtual Database Engine]

### Future

* If I were to continue reading into the implementation,
  I think the opcodes that manipulate B-trees would likely be
  the most interesting ones to look at.

## Summary

This is a very high-quality C library.

* Internal commenting is good.
* Consistent syntax is used, despite being a bit odd IMHO.
* The guide-level documentation is wonderful.
* Error handling is air-tight and enforced by crazy amounts of test code. 
* The architecture provides good separation of roles and is easy to understand.
* Once again, the documentation is excellent.

And its design requirements show through in the implementation:

**Reliable**

* There is more than 1000 times as much test code as there is product code.
* 100% branch coverage. That's insanely good.
* Very crazy error classes such as out of memory errors, crashes, integer overflow are all considered and tested for.
    * Malloc checks are prevalent and handled.
    * Transactions, journaling, and related testing deal with crashes.

**Portable**

* The chosen language is C, which is highly portable when written in the appropriate style.
* The so-called VFS layer provides an OS abstraction. Thus porting to an OS mainly just involves writing a new implementation of this abstraction.
* All C files are combined into one giant C file before being sent to the compiler, which provides for better compile-time optimizations for dumber C compilers, which may occur on embedded systems.
* The database format does not depend on endianness or native data type sizes, making it suitable for cross-platform use.
* Very low memory configurations are available, making SQLite suitable for use on embedded devices such as cellphones.
* The code is in the public domain, which removes any licensing barriers.

**Simple**

* SQLite is embedded into the program that uses it, requiring no separate server. And no administration for such a server.
* Minimal schema is imposed by SQLite, distinguishing only between integers, reals, text, and blobs at a low level. And even so, a column's type is advisory only - you can store a value of any type in any column (except an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` column).

Of course being simple sacrifices certain other properties such as high concurrency and the ability to perform fine-grained access control (which requires administrability).

[Architecture Documentation]: http://www.sqlite.org/arch.html
[The Virtual Database Engine]: http://www.sqlite.org/vdbe.html
[Virtual Machine Opcodes]: http://www.sqlite.org/opcode.htmlI've been using [BBEdit] as my primary text editor on the Mac for over 10 years. It is an extremely capable and mature editor with just about all the bells and whistles you can imagine. However the use of Sublime Text has been spreading throughout my workplace at Splunk[^splunk] so I decided I'd give it a try.

My initial impression was "BBEdit can do everything that Sublime can, what's the deal?" But after using Sublime full-time for about a week, I'm starting to come around to it.

Although it is true that both have comparable feature sets, Sublime's implementation feels more polished - not just eyecandy, but actually better usability.

* Incremental find
    * As you start typing the substring you want to find, it automatically starts searching within the current document. Frequently you don't have to finish typing the substring in order to get the result you want.
    * This saves a surprising amount of time compared to BBEdit where you have to finish providing a full substring (that you think is long enough) before kicking off the search.
    * **Edit:** *This is actually available in BBEdit under the "Live Search" command, but this is not part of the default Find experience and not advertised.*
* View a file without "opening" it (as a persistent tab)
    * Sublime keeps files of current interest available as tabs in the main window. If you just click on a file, it is shown in the editor but no tab is created by default. If you decide this is an important file, you can double-click on the file name to create an actual tab for it, which makes the file easy to return to.
        * Most "Goto X" actions in Sublime both show a file and create an actual tab for it, which usually is what you want.
    * If you click on any file at all in BBEdit, it is "opened" and added to the "Currently Open Documents" section, which is analogous to Sublime's set of open tabs. This can result in the "Currently Open Documents" section getting rather cluttered when rummaging around for a particular document, making it less useful.
* Minidocument view on the right side of an open file.
    * This makes it easier to get a bird's eye view of where you are in a long function or file.

Additionally, Sublime's marketing has some a much better job of exposing advanced features that turn out to be useful in daily use.

* "Goto Anything"
    * BBEdit has similar "Open File by Name", but it's slower, doesn't have as expressive syntax, and isn't incremental.
* "Open Folder"
    * This is equivalent to a BBEdit project.
* Plugins!
    * This is barely advertised on the BBEdit side but hugely promoted on the Sublime side. Thus lots of people are writing (publicly available) plugins for Sublime but not so many for BBEdit.

Some features in Sublime are named more obviously:

* Convert Indentation to Spaces. Convert Indentation to Tabs.
    * BBEdit calls these operations "Detab" and "Entab" respectively.

Some features in Sublime are easier to access:

* Change the displayed tab width.
    * To change this for a single file in BBEdit, you have to go to "Show Fonts", which I find completely nonintuitive.
    * BBEdit also allows you to change the default tab spacing *per source language* in its preferences, which makes sense given that different languages have different conventions.
    * However BBEdit does not permit you to change the tab width on a per project/folder basis, which is usually what you want when working on someone else's open source project.
* Access the function list. ("Goto Symbol...")
    * This can be done in Sublime entirely through the keyboard.

Sublime also has a few features lacking in BBEdit:

* Cross-platform support
    * This is huge when working in a mixed OS environment. You can use the same editor everywhere.

BBEdit still is better in a few areas:

* Can edit preferences in a GUI without mucking about in text files.
* Can quickly split a single file vertically to edit distant sections simultaneously.
* "Zap Gremlins..."
    * Deletes or replaces ASCII control characters and other nasties. Very useful for text pasted from web browsers, Word, or other less-than-pure sources of text.
* "Process Duplicate Lines..."
    * Eliminate duplicate lines in a file. This is often useful after performing a series of text transformations.
* "Process Lines Containing..."
    * Delete (or preserve) all lines containing a subexpression. Exactly like the `grep` command-line tool.
* Can edit files on an FTP/SFTP server directly.
* Customer support I've heard is top-notch.

I think I'm going to continue using Sublime Text. Featurewise it's about the same as BBEdit, but the cross-platform support[^cross-plat], active plugin community, and general polish <!-- & attention to usability --> are winning me over.

[BBEdit]: http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html

[^splunk]: Splunk makes tools for analyzing large time-series datasets, such as log files. For details see the 3 minute [Splunk Product Overview](http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAHG6). I work on the Developer Platform, making it easy for other developers to build neat things on top of the Splunk core.

[^cross-plat]: It is extremely useful to be able to use the same full-featured text editor on any platform I use. I currently maintain a few open source projects that require testing, debugging, and development on multiple platforms (notably the [RDiscount](/projects/rdiscount/) Markdown processor) and it's nice being able to use the same editor everywhere.**p4status** works like `git status` (or `svn status`), but works in Perforce.

It will list changelist files and locally modified files that haven't been added to any changelist (including unadded files) in a readable format.

</pre>

### Installation

* Download to your local `bin` directory:
  <https://github.com/davidfstr/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/p4status>
* Mark as executable with `chmod a+x p4status`

### Usage

* `cd` to the primary directory that you'll be working under.
* Run `p4status`.

### Limitations

* Only detects unstaged files under the directory in which the command is run. Therefore it is best to reserve a terminal window that is `cd`-ed to the correct place where this command can be run safely.

* This command is too slow to run from the root of very large branches.

### Alternatives

* Use the excellent Git-to-Perforce bridge, [git-p4].
    * This allows you to work with your Perforce repository as if it were a Git repository. And you can use Git's very fast `git status` command.
* Convince your Perforce server administrator to upgrade to the 2012 version. This may take some time, depending on the size of your company.

[git-p4]: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-p4A *killer app* is any product that is so desirable that it fuels the sale/adoption of a larger technology that the product depends on.

The gaming industry has been aware of the power of killer apps for a while, and often seeks to create launch titles for their new gaming systems that are killer apps. Microsoft, for example, deliberately created the first Halo game at same time as their Xbox console. And Nintendo has repeatedly introduced new Mario titles with its new consoles.

<!-- Similarly, some of the classic examples of killer apps were the first entrants in new software categories: word processors (WordStar) and spreadsheets (VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3). -->

However what may not be so obvious is that killer apps exist for learning new software platforms as well, such as for APIs, SDKs, and programming languages.

Learning a new platform (along with the associated tools and ecosystem) takes a large investment of *time*, and so there is a similar barrier to adoption as, say, the monetary cost of buying a new game console.

I think the platform-builders in the software industry could learn from the gaming industry and strategically introduce killer apps alongside new platform offerings.  I can think of no prior case where this was done deliberately (see the Appendix below), so I think our industry (i.e. software) is really missing out.

[^outlook]: Although Microsoft has finally created a version of Outlook for the Mac, it is buggy and missing a number of advanced features of the Windows version. Thus two of my colleagues <!-- Neeraj and Dee --> who do a lot of planning run Outlook specifically on Windows despite the workplace being otherwise Mac-oriented.Generally [Racket] appears to be a very usable dialect of Lisp/Scheme.

Racket is particularly well suited for those who want to develop their own programming language (including those not based on S-expressions), given that the creators of Racket are programming language researchers. For example, a number of Racket subsets have been created to assist students who are learning Racket/Scheme via the [How to Design Programs] book.[^Racket-subsets] The Arc language by Paul Graham is also implemented in the Racket environment.

Racket's developers wanted to make sure it was a *practical* language. To that end, there is a bundled IDE (DrRacket) with syntax highlighting, parentheses matching, and integrated debugging. There is also a package management system (PLaneT).[^import-planet] And built-in libraries for working with several real-world systems, such as GUIs, networking, databases, JSON/XML, etc. A cross-platform executable can easily be built. And everything is well documented.

Graphics and GUI programs are supported better than the average language. For example pictures are rendered natively in the Racket REPL, including their use within expressions. And the built-in Racket GUI library is fairly decent.

The combination of a decent built-in GUI library along with the ability to compile cross-platform executables makes Racket useful for writing cross-platform GUI applications.

## Racket's GUI library (RacketGUI)

The original version of Racket's GUI library was implemented on top of wxWidgets.[^gui-rewrite] Thus some of wxWidget's poor design decisions leak through:

* A visual component is called a "window", not a control.
* Visual components must be associated with their parent container at creation time.

However, some fixes were made too:

* There is no notion of a wxWidgets "sizer" as distinct from a "container window".
    * This simplifies the mental model considerably, since it is no longer necessary to keep track of both a "window" hierarchy and a sizer hierarchy.
    * Instead, a wxWidgets "sizer" is represented as a lightweight RacketGUI "pane", which can be nested naturally inside containers along with other components.
* The event handling loop is managed in the background automatically.

Sadly, RacketGUI lacks some advanced controls I often want:

* trees
* tables containing controls in cells
    * However the `list-box%` control supports cells that only contain text.
* tree-tables

This is not surprising since these controls are hard to implement and are not well-supported by the original underlying wxWidgets library:

* The wxWidgets tree interface (wxTreeCtrl) is annoying for dynamically generated trees.
* Tables (wxListCtrl) only support text and image cells, not controls as cells.

[^import-planet]: It is possible to import modules directly from the PLaneT repository, which will automatically download and install the module if it isn't already present. Neat!
[How to Design Programs]: http://htdp.org
[^Racket-subsets]: The [HtDP](http://htdp.org) book uses the dialects "Beginning Student", "Intermediate Student", and "Advanced Student". These sublanguages restrict the use of certain language features (such as using functions as objects) and can provide better error messages (which avoid mentioning advanced features not supported by the sublanguage).
[^gui-rewrite]: Racket's GUI layer has apparently been redone a couple of times. Originally it was based on wxWidgets. Later it was rewritten to about 200,000 lines of C++ glue to Xt, Win32, and Carbon. Then in Racket 5.1 it was replaced with about 80,000 lines of Racket glue to Gtk, Win32, Cocoa, Cairo, and Pango. That's a 60% reduction in code! More details on the [Racket blog](http://blog.racket-lang.org/2010/12/racket-version-5.html).## What is Prolog?

Prolog is a declarative programming language that, given a list of axioms and a list of implication rules, can deduce the truth (or falsehood) of a logical statement.

For example, given the following knowledge base (AKA *database*):

<pre>
% Axiom: Mary likes Ted.
likes(mary,ted).
% Axiom: Jane likes Ted.
likes(jane,ted).
% Rule: X is jealous of Y if they both like Z (and are not the same person).
jealous(X,Y) :- likes(X,Z), likes(Y,Z), X \= Y.
</pre>

I can ask the question `jealous(mary,jane)` and get the affirmation `true`.
Or I can ask the question `jealous(mary,mary)` and get the denial `false`.[^period-question]

I can also ask a more complicated question containing variables and Prolog will derive the possible values (and relations) the variables must have in order to make the question posed to be true.

For example, asking the question `jealous(X,Y)` will give the results:

<pre>
X = mary,
Y = jane ;
X = jane,
Y = mary
</pre>

As another (more interesting) example, consider the knowledge base:

<pre>
% Rule: A line is horizontal if its points have the same Y coordinate.
horizontal(line( point(_,Y), point(_,Y) )).
% Rule: A line is vertical if its points have the same X coordinate.
vertical(line( point(X,_), point(X,_) )).
</pre>

And the questions:

<pre>
(1) horizontal(line( point(0,0), point(X,Y) )).  ==>  Y = 0.
(2) horizontal(line( point(0,0), P2 )).          ==>  P2 = point(_G327, 0).
</pre>

The second question is particularly interesting because it gave back a fairly complicated answer: `P2` must be a `point`, its X coordinate can be anything, but its Y coordinate must be zero. I think it's particularly cool that Prolog can deduce that P2 must be a point. <!-- LPN §2.1 -->

As a final example of a simple problem solvable by Prolog, consider the [crossword puzzle] in Exercise 2.4 of "Learn Prolog Now!". You can write a Prolog program to solve crossword puzzles!

[^period-question]: When posing a question in the Prolog interpreter, you must include a trailing period at the end of the question.

[crossword puzzle]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse7


## When is Prolog useful?

Prolog's deduction capabilities makes it useful for answering questions and making deductions within systems whose concepts can be expressed in a formal hierarchy. <!-- LPN §2.1 -->

In academia, for example, Prolog has been used to investigate natural language formalizations and expert systems in artificial intelligence. <!-- LPN §2.1 -->

### Case Study: Java bytecode verifier

As a more practical example, Prolog has also been used to define the semantics of the Java bytecode verifier[^java-verifier] for Java 6.[^cite-java-prolog] Prior versions of Java had a verifier whose semantics were defined by a textual specification only (namely the Java Virtual Machine Specification).

There are a few advantages to having the verifier defined in terms of Prolog:

* The specification becomes formal (and thereby unambiguous and more likely to be error-free).
* The execution model for performing the verification becomes well-defined (since it would use Prolog's) and fast (since Prolog's core unification algorithm is fast<!-- LPN §2.1 -->).

[^java-verifier]: The job of the Java bytecode verifier is to examine a compiled Java program and check whether it is well-structured and therefore (reasonably) safe for the Java virtual machine to execute. For example the verifier would reject a Java program containing a command to jump to an instruction location outside of the current method.

[^cite-java-prolog]: See the [Java Virtual Machine Specification](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/index.html). Particularly "Preface to the Java SE 7 Edition" and §4.10 "Verification of class Files".


## Writing Programs

### Functions as Rules

So how do you actually write something resembling a *program* in Prolog? Until now we've been talking about axioms, rules, and questions. But in most languages a program consists of a series of expressions that are evaluated.

For example in Python, you might write:

<pre>
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

print add(5, 3)    # prints 8
</pre>

In Prolog, you can do something similar by defining a rule where one of the variables in the rule (typically the last one) is its "output":

<pre>
add(X, Y, Result) :- Result is X + Y.
</pre>

To actually evaluate this "function" with 5 and 3 you would ask the question `add(5, 3, Result)` which would yield `Result = 8`.

Now, don't get trapped into the idea that such as rule always needs to be evaluated in one direction. In Prolog you have the additional power to ask what the "inputs" of the function has to be to yield an already-known "output".

For example, you could ask the question `add(X, 3, 8)` to deduce that "input" X must be 5.[^is-problems] You could even try asking `add(X, Y, 8)` to find all values of X and Y that yield 8 as a result (although there are an infinite number of such combinations in this example).[^collecting-solutions]

This power to flip functions on their head is a unique quality of Prolog. (And it blows my mind.)

Ultimately a rule specifies a set of relationships between its arguments. Thus arguments can be "inputs", "outputs", or even temporary variables (like accumulators).

[^is-problems]: Unfortunately the `is` clause in this example cannot be run "backwards", so this particular question will fail. (I am not sure why this particular restriction on `is` exists.)

[^collecting-solutions]: A Prolog *program* that wanted to collect all combinations of inputs in this fashion (as opposed to a user at the interpreter) would probably use a combination of the `findall`, `bagof`, and `setof` special rules. See [LPN §11.2 "Collecting Solutions"](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse49) for more information.

### Processing Recursive Data Structures

Processing recursive data structures such as lists and trees is mind bending... For examples see:

* [LPN §6.1 "Append"] and
* [LPN §6.2 "Reversing a List"].

[LPN §6.1 "Append"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse24
[LPN §6.2 "Reversing a List"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse25


## Interactive Use (as a REPL)

It is possible to run Prolog in an interactive fashion by using the `assert` special rule at runtime to define new statements (i.e. axioms and rules). And `listing` will display the set of statements that have been defined. Finally `retract` and `retractall` can be used to undefine statements.

These special rules, however, are not restricted to use in the interpreter - they can also be used at runtime by rules in programs. For example memoization[^memo] is a good use for dynamic calls to `assert`.

[LPN §2.2 "Proof Search"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse6
[LPN §2.4 "Practical Session"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse8

[^memo]: Memoization is where a function that computes a value caches the result of the computation so that repeated invocations with the same input can immediately return the saved result. This can speed of performance in certain applications. See [LPM §11.1 "Database Manipulation"](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse48) for an example.


## Question Evaluation <small>(Unification, Backtracking)</small>

When evaluating a question, Prolog takes the question expression and matches it against the axioms and rules in the input knowledge base. The algorithm used for matching is called *unification*. While performing unification, Prolog makes guesses about what values should be assigned to each variable in the question expression. If it encounters a contradiction, it *backtracks* to one of its previous guesses and revises the guess. This process is described graphically in [LPN §2.2 "Proof Search"].

Although Prolog is a declarative language, the precise behavior of evaluating queries depends on the order that rules and clauses are defined. In particular the performance of the same program can vary significantly depending on ordering. As another gotcha, if you define rules in a left-recursive fashion (as opposed to a right-recursive one), Prolog will go into an infinite loop when evaluating the rule.

It is possible to debug (and step through) the evaluation of a question expression using the **trace** command, which is described in [LPN §2.4 "Practical Session"]. This is useful for investigating performance issues.

### Cuts

It is possible to optimize the execution of a Prolog rule by adding a **cut** as a clause. This is written as a bang (`!`). Unfortunately to use cuts effectively (and correctly), you have to understand the exact execution model used by Prolog. It is quite easy to unwittingly insert a cut that actually changes the semantics of the original rule. <!-- LPN §10.1, §10.2 -->

There are even hacks you can do with cuts such as implementing "negation as failure" (`\+`). But again you have to be very careful since cuts can change your knowledge base's semantics. <!-- LPN §10.3 -->


## Side Effects & I/O

Some built-in clauses trigger side effects when they are examined by the unification algorithm. Programs take advantage of such "impure predicates" to do I/O and other types of side-effecting work.

For example asking the question `print('Hello')` will print `Hello` to the screen.[^str-symbol]

To write to a file you might define:

<pre>
printfile(Filename, Text) :-
    open(Filename, write, Stream),
    write(Stream, Text), nl(Stream),
    close(Stream).
</pre>

And then pose the question `printfile('hogwarts.txt', 'Hogwarts')`.

During evaluation, the `printfile` is rewritten to `open(...) AND write(...) AND nl(...) AND close(...)`. Each of those subclauses is then each evaluated to `true` (performing the associated side effect) and the overall clause becomes just `true`.

[^str-symbol]: Note that `'Hello'` (with single quotes) is a variable, not a string. The string `"Hello"` (with double quotes) is equivalent to a list of codepoints (`[72, 101, 108, 108, 111]`).

## Role of Programming Languages

Languages should:

* provide the means for **combining simple ideas to form complex ideas**,
* provide the means for **abstracting units of computation**, and
* serve as a framework within which we **organize our ideas about processes**.

Units of computation can be abstracted in several forms:

* **procedure** - *Assigns names to common patterns, allowing you to work in terms of the named abstractions directly.*
    * AKA function, method
* **abstract data type** - *Allows the choice of representation (i.e. the implementation) to vary separately from the API (i.e. the interface).*[^impl-vs-interface]
    * Built-in language support is often provided in the form of **classes**.
    * See also: LISP constructors
        * AKA **constructor** or **static factory method** in other languages
    * See also: LISP selectors
        * AKA **accessors**, mutators, or **properties** in other languages
* **module**[^mod-asm] - *Groups several procedures and data types into a namespace independent from other modules.*
    * AKA package (Java), namespace (C++), module (Python)
    * Languages that don't have built-in support for this concept typically use prefixes to create de-facto namespaces. (C, Objective-C, PHP < 5.3.0)
* **assembly** - *Groups several modules together in a single versioned [^versioning] package. Assemblies can depend on other assemblies, often from separate vendors.*
    * AKA **shared library** (C, C++), gem (Ruby), egg (Python)

[^impl-vs-interface]: For example, complex numbers can be expressed in rectangular (a + b*i*) or polar form (r*cos(𝜽)). -- Some representations are better than others for different operations. Adding works better in rectangular form. Multiplying works better in polar form.

[^versioning]: Versioning assemblies effectively is a challenging topic onto itself. If done without care you get so-called "dependency hell". Just getting a consistent version numbering scheme can be tricky. One popular versioning scheme is codified as [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

[^mod-asm]: SICP does not mention the notion of a *module* or an *assembly*, however these are common higher-level units for abstracting computation in languages other than Lisp.

## Abstract Data Types

<a id="lisp-vs-pascal-design-philosophies"></a>
### Lisp vs. Pascal Design Philosophies

*For you youngin's that have never used Pascal, just replace "Pascal" with "Java" in this section and you should get the right idea.*

Two design philosophies:

* **Lisp-school**: Create abstract data types by combining a *small* set of general-purpose data types (particularly collections). These complex structures can then be manipulated using operations on these general-purpose types.

    * *"Lisp is for building organisms -­ imposing, breathtaking, dynamic structures built by squads fitting fluctuating myriads of simpler organisms into place."*
    
    * *"Lisp programs inflate libraries with functions whose utility transcends the application that produced them."*


* **Pascal-school**: Create *many* special-purpose data types (i.e. classes) and specialized operations to manipulate them.

    * *"Pascal is for building pyramids -­ imposing, breathtaking, static structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place."*
    
    * *"In Pascal the plethora of declarable data structures induces a specialization within functions that inhibits and penalizes casual cooperation."*

Roughly speaking, I think of the Lisp philosophy as **programming with collections** and the Pascal philosophy as **programming with classes**.[^nonviable]

#### Usage

The Pascal philosophy has won out in most statically typed languages such as C++ and Java, and in languages with poor (or nonexistent) built-in collections.

The Lisp philosophy is more common in dynamically typed languages that lack built-in support for classes, such as Lisp itself and JavaScript.

A hybrid approach (using both philosophies) is seen in languages that are dynamically typed, have built-in collections, and have built-in classes, such as Python and Ruby.

[^nonviable]: In my opinion, a language that supports neither first-class collections nor first-class classes is non-viable for large scale general purpose software development. C, Assembly, and Fortran fall into this category.

<a id="polymorphism"></a>
### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is where multiple abstract data types implement a common *interface*, which is typically defined as a series of methods that can be called on all implementing types.

This allows client code, when given an object known only to implement a particular interface, to invoke interface methods on the object and end up calling the correct implementation of that method depending on the runtime type of the object.

#### Implementation Strategies

Polymorphism can be implemented in several different ways:

* **Switch on Typecode**
    * Easiest to implement. Hardest to maintain.
    * Treated as an anti-pattern in many OO languages.
* **Virtual Lookup Tables**
    * AKA "data-directed programming" (in SICP) or v-tables (C++)
    * Default implementation strategy for most OO languages.
* **Message Passing**
    * Most flexible.

Many languages provide a *default implementation strategy* as a language construct. For example C++ and Java use virtual lookup tables. Smalltalk and Objective-C use message passing. C doesn't give you anything for free, so you have to roll your own polymorphism.

#### Tradeoffs

These implementation strategies for polymorphism have some tradeoffs, which are worth knowing:

* Virtual lookup tables are restricted in that *the total set of operations on the abstract data type must be known in advance*.
* Message passing, on the other hand, can be made more flexible: 
    * Implementing data types may choose to support more operations than the standard set on the interface.[^vfs]
    * Heck, individual *instances* can choose to support more operations than the standard set.
        * In such cases, you would want to interrogate (i.e. reflect on) an individual instance to determine what operations (i.e. messages) it understands/supports.

[^vfs]: For example, the Linux virtual filesystem, which is implemented in message-passing style, has a common set of operations that all filesystems are expected to support (ex: `unlink`). However individual filesystems may support additional operations: For example the HFS+ filesystem on Mac OS X additionally supports a `delete` operation, which has slightly different semantics than the standard `unlink` operation.

<a id="cross-type-operations"></a>
### Cross-Type Operations

Introducing **cross-type operations**, such as `add(Integer, Complex)`, is a very tricky design issue.

Having explicit functions that operate on all combinations of types is possible but highly verbose. With **n** types and **m** operations, you need <strong>n*m</strong> functions to implement all combinations. Impractical.

Another strategy is to use *coercion* to convert a value from one type to another. So instead of defining `add(Integer, Complex)`, just define `convertToComplex(Integer) : Complex`, and use the existing `add(Complex, Complex)`. To convert between all types requires at least **n** but no more than **n<sup>2</sup>** conversion functions.

Many programming languages have built-in facilities to automatically coerce types. For some languages (like JavaScript or PHP) these coersion rules are quite complex (and error-prone). Other languages (like ML) ban implicit coercion entirely.

* Java only has coercion for built-in types.
* C++ lets the datatype designer choose (via `implicit` or explicit one-argument constructors).
* Scala relies on implicit coercion a lot to enable foreign methods to be introduced on types.

One wrinkle is that these conversion functions might introduce a loss in precision. For example not every integer can be represented as double of exactly the same value.

<a id="assignments-mutable-state-and-side-effects"></a>
## Assignments, Mutable State, and Side Effects

Introducing assignment creates lots of complications. In particular *referential transparency* is lost. Optimizations related to reordering and coalescing expressions need to be a lot more careful. Static reasoning of various kinds is impaired.

To reduce bugs it is best to minimize the use of mutation by using immutable objects whenever possible.[^large-structs]

Haskell takes a very aggressive stance against assignments, mutable state, and other side effects: they are banned by default. However Haskell does allow side effects within the context of a **monad**. This is a special construct unique to Haskell (so far as I know).

[^large-structs]: A common case where eliminating mutation may *not* be practical is when defining and working with large data structures that need many small updates made to them over time. If such a structure were made immutable, there would be a large performance penalty for recopying the entire structure whenever a small change needed to be made.

<a id="lazy-evaluation"></a>
### Lazy Evaluation

Normally expressions are evaluated immediately, in the order that they occur in code. **Lazy evaluation** changes this behavior such that expressions are only evaluated when some primitive operation (like print or add) requires the value of the expression. Until then the unevaluated expression is passed around (as a "thunk").

Lazy evaluation enables that creation of **lazy data structures**, which is a useful performance optimization in some contexts.

Unrestricted mutation and lazy evaluation do not mix well in programming languages. Since unrestricted mutation is very common in mainstream programming languages, it is quite rare to be in an environment that supports lazy evaluation. Haskell is one of the few.

<a id="declarative-languages"></a>
## Declarative Languages

Logic programming languages are at the far declarative end of the
imperative-declarative spectrum. They can be used to deduce answers
from a set of initial set of declarative statements.

[Prolog] is the best-known example of a logic programming language.

Query systems for databases are a type of logic programming language.

A "query" (i.e. an expression in the language) is transformed into a
"query plan" (i.e. a specific set of steps to follow) by a query planner. The implemented of these planners is quite complex.

## Conclusion

So those are a few interesting things I learned from reading SICP. Taking notes while reading made it a lot easier for me to remember the content. You might try it when reading a technical book with a lot of new concepts.

I like learning new languages to get myself to think about problems in different ways.

Here's a list of a few well-known languages I've worked with and some of the more interesting features I've encountered:

### C

* **Undefined behavior**
    * The idea that a language specification would explicitly specify certain constructs as having undefined behavior is interesting. Most specifications leave things undefined by omission, not commission.
    * Although this allows various compiler optimizations, many developers rely on their particular compiler's implementation of undefined behavior without even realizing it.[^overflow]

[^overflow]: For example it is undefined what happens when you add to an integer variable and the variable overflows. In most compilers adding 1 to the largest integer wraps around to result in the smallest integer, and thus a number of programs depend on this behavior. Other compilers [assume overflow is impossible](http://thiemonagel.de/2010/01/signed-integer-overflow/).

### Java

* **Objects are the primary unit of composition**
    * There are no standalone functions.
    * Design Patterns can be used to describe high level object coordination patterns.
    * However sometimes the community's focus on objects can be a bit extreme[^java-rant].
* **Checked exceptions**
    * Great when used *sparingly*, as it forces the caller to handle expected error conditions.    
        * I do think that it was a usability error to make `Exception` checked and `RuntimeException` unchecked. Rather it should be `Exception` that is *unchecked* and a new `CheckedException` should be the base for all checked exceptions. This makes it clear that *unchecked* exceptions should be the default.
    * Managing checked exceptions *correctly* is quite difficult. <!-- TODO: ARTICLE-IDEA -->
* **Unicode strings**
    * Tons of other languages use "bytestrings" as the main string type which causes all kinds of problems when working with international characters. <!-- TODO: ARTICLE-IDEA -->
* **Documentation focus**
    * Every library is expected to have JavaDoc documentation, which is generated from documentation comments in the source
    * This is really powerful, since it makes it easy for developers to write documentation, and to do so at the same time the implementation is coded, when the desired behavior is most fresh in the mind.
* **Compatibility focus**
    * I have never seen a community so focused on maintaining backward compatibility. I can't think of a single deprecated method in the Java library that was actually deleted.
    * Even the Java Language Specification has an entire chapter devoted to [binary compatibility](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/binaryComp.html).
    * This focus may be partially attributable to the early mantra of [Write once, run anywhere][wora].
* **Garbage Collection**
    * Being freed from the confines of manual memory management makes it a ton easier to focus on more important things.

[^java-rant]: Steve Yegge has a great rant on the over-focus on objects in the Java community: [Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html)

[wora]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere

### C&#35;

Very similar to Java.[^java-copycat]

* **Assemblies**
    * This is a level of encapsulation above the typical namespaces or modules in most languages. Assemblies are similar to the idea of static/dynamic libraries in C or JAR files in Java.
    * Notably, you can mark members as `internal`, which makes them public within the same assembly, but private to everybody outside the assembly. This is quite useful.
* **Cross-language compatibility is first-class** (not just for C)
    * C# runs in the Common Language Runtime, which was designed from the beginning to support interoperability between languages.
* **Properties are first-class**
    * No longer need to write explicit getter and (optional) setter methods.
* **Listeners are first-class**
    * Classes can declare an *event* `Foo` with `addFooListener` and `removeFooListener` functionality built in.
    * Unfortunately the implementation has some annoyances[^event-flaw].
* **Foreign Methods[^foreign-method] are first-class**
    * C# calls these *extension methods*.
* **Partial Classes**
    * Allows a class's members to be defined in multiple files.
    * Useful to add functionality to a generated class (for example, from a parser generator) without those modifications getting lost when the class is next regenerated.

[^java-copycat]: C# is by design almost a direct copy of Java. It amazes me that Microsoft (C#'s sponsor) would spend so much effort making a copy of an existing language.

[^foreign-method]: I am referring to the [Foreign Method](http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/introduceForeignMethod.html) design pattern here, not a native function from a [foreign function interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface).

[^event-flaw]: If you invoke an uninitialized event-property, it will throw a `NullReferenceException` instead of ignoring your request, as you would expect. Workaround by initializing events with an empty delegate.

### Python

* **Indentation is significant**
    * Everyone notices this pretty fast.
    * Overall I think requiring correct indentation is a Good Thing™, as it contributes directly to *readable* code.
    * However this makes lambda expressions much less powerful than in other languages, since you can't easily nest statements inside a lambda expression without explicit braces (or similar delimiters).
    * Another side effect of having significant indentation is that the choice of tabs vs. spaces really matters. If you mix them, your program probably won't run.
* **Interactive interpreter (REPL)**
    * Amazingly useful for prototyping quickly, running experiments, and learning the language.
* **Collections are first class**
    * You can type `[1,2,3]` to get a list, `{'key': 'value'}` to get a dictionary, and `{1,2,3}` to get a set. So much faster than `new ArrayList<Integer>(...)`, `new HashMap<Integer>(...)`, or `new HashSet<Integer>(...)`.
* **Functions are first class**
    * You can declare them as literals, pass them around, and create higher-order functions that take functions as parameters.
    * Functions can also live on their own without an enclosing class, in contrast to Java. This is often the simplest approach for a given implementation.
* **"Magic" marked explicitly**
    * Anything "magic" that the language treats specially has names surrounded by double underscores.
    * For example:
        * An object's constructor is called `__init__`.
        * The method implementing an operator overload for plus is called `__add__`.
        * A class's metaclass is held by the `__metaclass__` field.
* **Generators** and **Coroutines**
    * Generators enable straightforward *pulling* of values from a complex data source (like a parsed data structure).
    * Coroutines enable straightforward *pushing* of values to a complex data sink.
    * Python calls both constructs a *generator*.

### JavaScript

* **No blocking I/O**
    * All I/O is non-blocking and asynchronous. This results in heavy use of [continuation passing style].
* **Successful despite huge flaws**
    * Ease of deployment and ubiquity (i.e. business considerations) trump ease of use. (PHP also wins for the same reason.)
    * A few flaws:
        * Everything is in the one global namespace.
        * No user-defined namespaces, modules, or importing of other files.[^js-no-namespaces]
        * No built-in facility for classes.[^js-no-classes]
        * Bizarre loose semantics for `==`.[^js-equality]
        * Multiple illegal value sentinels: `null` and `undefined`.[^js-truthy]
* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
    * A fantastically compact, readable, and portable notation for representing all kinds of data structures. Great for data interchange.

[continuation passing style]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style

[^js-no-namespaces]: Hence workarounds like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) to get includes and modules.

[^js-no-classes]: Hence reimplementions of class semantics in libraries like MooTools, Prototype, and [random blog posts](http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/). (That blog post has the best implementation, IMHO.)

[^js-equality]: Hence recommendations to always use `===` instead of `==`.

[^js-truthy]: Hence recommendations to only depend on the "truthy" and "falsy" values of expressions instead of direct comparisons with `null` or `undefined`.

### Haskell

* **Lazy evaluation**
    * Expressions are only evaluated when some primitive operation (like `print` or `add`) requires the value of the expression.
    * Allows you to define your own control flow operators.[^control-flow]
    * Allows you to extract complex expressions without fear of introducing a performance hit (since the expression will only actually be evaluated if it is needed).
* **Side effects banned by default**
    * Mutation of data structures and I/O, both of which have order-sensitive side effects, are not allowed except within the confines of **monad**.
    * A **monad** is a construct that explicitly controls evaluation order, in contrast to the usual unpredictable lazy evaluation behavior.
* **`null` banned by default.**
    * Unlike many languages, there is no special `null` value in Haskell that can be substituted anywhere.
    * Instead if a function wants to return a value of type `T` or null, you would declare the function as returning type `Option<T>`, which could either have the value `Some(tValue)` or `None`. When declared in this way, callers are *required* to handle both possibilies.
* **Type inference (+ static typing)**
    * The benefits of static typing without the need to specify the types for everything?  
      Count me in!

[^control-flow]: Want to implement Ruby's `until` loop or `unless` conditional? No problem.

### Lisp <small>(Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure)[^lisp-dialects]</small>

* **Homoiconic**
    * When you write a Lisp program, the notation you use (the *grammar*) is equivalent to what a compiler would see (an *abstract syntax tree* or *AST*).
    * Furthermore this Lisp code is represented as a nested structure of lists, symbols, and literals, all of which can be directly generated and manipulated in Lisp itself!
    * This allows Lisp code to generate list structures which can then be run as Lisp code directly.
        * Generation can be done at *compile* time with **macros**.
        * Generation can be done at *runtime* as well, and then invoked with **eval**.
    * However the highly uniform structure of Lisp code, devoid of operator and syntactic diversity, makes for lousy typography and thus low readability.
* **Macros**
    * A function that transforms the AST of its operands at *compile* time to new code.
    * Macros can be used to generate arbitrary new statements and control structures.
        * Domain specific languages, in particular, are very easy to implement in Lisp thanks to macros.
    * Macros can also be used to perform code optimizations at compile time[^macro-optimize] (similar to  "template metaprogramming" in C++).
    * Fluent use of macros requires the host language to be homoiconic, which is rare. Thus Lisp remains the only well-known language family that has macros.
* **Lisp Conditions and Restarts**
    * Allows bidirectional communication between different parts of the call stack. More powerful than exceptions, since conditions can not only unwind the stack but also wind it back again via a restart.
* **Call-with-current-continuation**
    * Allows you to save the current execution state of the program in a variable and jump back to it later. Multiple times, even. It's like a friggin' time machine. You can implement fairly complex control flow operators with this function.

[^lisp-dialects]: There are more dialects of Lisp than any other language I can think of. These 3 (Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure) are just the most popular dialects. I've directly used [Racket](/articles/2013/03/01/notes-on-racket/) in the past, which is itself a dialect of Scheme.

[^macro-optimize]: Prismatic performs efficient [compile-time DOM templating](http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2013/1/22/the-magic-of-macros-lighting-fast-templating-in-clojurescript) in ClojureScript using macros.

### Other

* **Fexprs**
    * A function whose operands are passed to it at runtime without being evaluated.
    * Similar to macros and lazy evaluation in terms of power.
    * Has fallen out of favor since the 1980s due to being difficult for compilers to optimize. Also it is hard to provide good error messages.
    * Furthermore most fexpr functions tend to rely on *eval* to continue evaluating its operands. The use of *eval* has its own problems...

<p>I love programming. It tickles me when I stumble across a new programming language that lets me express concepts in a more clear and direct fashion. I love the cleanness and order that results after a good round of refactoring<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I enjoy the challenge of hacking away at a fiddly problem and testing all the cases to get a correct and bulletproof solution.</p>

<p>However I have realized programming is merely an activity. It is a <em>means</em>, not an <em>end</em>. My work is not inherently valuable because I have created a piece of software. Rather it is because I have created software <em>that solves somebody&rsquo;s problem</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Therefore it is the <em>problem</em> that deserves the most attention if you want to make a difference that people care about. In that vein I have been learning about the precepts of Customer Development and Customer Discovery, which deals with how to efficiently interact with customers to discover a problem that they care about.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Direct customer interaction, such as through in-person interviews of the general public, is way outside my comfort zone. However I will persevere. I think it is a very important skill for actually making a dent in the universe.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p><em><b>TLDR:</b> Drupal is overly complex for a personal blog. It is hard to maintain. Simple static site generators are easier to work with in the long term.</em></p>

<p>My portfolio website was written during college using hand-coded HTML and used server-side includes to bring in common navigation.</p>

<p>Then in January 2010 I remade my site in Drupal. It gained lots of fancy features such as first-class support for project categories and project languages. You could subscribe to almost any page as a feed. There were project specific updates that could be commented on. From a feature point of view, it rocked.</p>

<p>But some problems became apparent over time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security updates were frequent and difficult to apply correctly.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t like writing articles on the site because I couldn&rsquo;t use simple markup formats such as Markdown.

<ul>
<li>Drupal has no good editor plugins for markup languages.</li>
<li>And its visual HTML editor generates messy HTML.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The theme I used for the site was complex and hard to modify.

<ul>
<li>And the CSS often interfered with my article markup, necessitating me to drop into HTML when editing certain articles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There was no sane way to test structural changes to the site locally and then automatically deploy them to production.

<ul>
<li>Normally this would be done by keeping the site structure in the filesystem and all user content in a database. This allows the filesystem contents to be easily deployed using <code>git push</code>, <code>rsync</code>, or similar techniques.</li>
<li>Drupal, by contrast, keeps its site structure in both the filesystem <em>and</em> in the database, along with user-generated content. Updating only the parts of the database related to site structure is cumbersome and error-prone.</li>
<li>Thus, I couldn&rsquo;t really change the site structure after my initial deployment to production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nothing was in revision control, which made me nervous.</li>
<li>I had to hack the Drupal core to get my contact form to work with my web hosting provider.</li>
<li>Most of the features of the site weren&rsquo;t being used by readers.</li>
</ul>


<p>So now I am rewriting my site yet again in straight HTML (via a simple static site generator) and outsourcing all user generated content (like comments) to third party service providers.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple simple simple.</li>
<li>Automatic security. The web server just serves static files.</li>
<li>Automatic scalability, for the same reason.</li>
<li>Simple authoring in Markdown with powerful client-side text editors.</li>
<li>Instant deployment with <code>git push</code>.</li>
<li>Everything in revision control.</li>
<li>I can use any web hosting provider. Hell, I can just use <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> for free.</li>
<li>Ultimate control over the site theme and CSS. I can fix problems myself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The old Retrospect 6.0</h2>

<p>In the past I have used Retrospect 6.0 to backup my Macs, since it was one of
the few programs that reliably backed up everything correctly, with all the
metadata intact. But it is looking much less attractive these days&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It no longer finds my laptop on the network reliably, due to some bug.
Especially when switching between wireless and wired networks.
Thus I often miss backups.</p></li>
<li><p>It is slow.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not groom backups.</p></li>
<li><p>It stores everything inside a single monolithic file,
which is at risk of corruption.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The new Retrospect 8.0</h2>

<p>The latest version of Retropect (8.0) is somewhat better but has some problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It does not seem to backup all attributes correctly.
For example, volume icons do not seem to be restored correctly.
Inaccurate backups are useless.</p></li>
<li><p>It is more complicated to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic grooming, although supported, is so slow to be practically unusable.
It takes maybe 2x as long to do one grooming operation as an incremental backup.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Time Machine</h2>

<p>Now there is Time Machine. Since my primary systems are 10.5+, I can use it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It <em>should</em> support reliable backup of all filesystem attributes,
since it was made by Apple, who is in a position to know about them.
Also, Apple typically makes solid products.</p></li>
<li><p>It has quick, automatic, incremental backups.</p></li>
<li><p>It also grooms automatically while it is backing up. Grooming behavior is
intelligent, keeping snapshots at sensible intervals.</p></li>
<li><p>The single-file restore interface is precise, intuitive, and fast.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Only wrinkle is that Time Machine is not really designed to backup to network
drives, however there are <a href="http://code.stephenmorley.org/articles/time-machine-on-a-network-drive/">instructions for circumventing this</a>.
(Of course there is Time Machine + Time Capsule for network backups, but a
Capsule is egregiously expensive.)</p>

<h3>2012 Update</h3>

<p>Time Machine misses a few filesystem attributes that Retrospect 6.0 nailed back
in the day, like volume icons.</p>

<p>I think it may also strip HFS+ extended attributes, since applications appear
to be quarantined after they are restored from a Time Machine backup.</p>

<p>One last nitpick is that TM has very poor handling for bad media and bad blocks.
In particular if your primary hard drive develops bad blocks, which is an early
sign of imminent failure, Time Machine will choke and refuse to backup the
entire volume. And this is exactly at the time you need it your files backed up
the most, when your hard drive is likely to fail.</p>

## Copyrights

The first time that a piece of software is published, whether it be in binary or source form, it automatically gains copyright status. This is true even if you don't include the magic words `Copyright (c) 2013 David Foster`.[^magic_words]

[^magic_words]: However if you *do* include the magic words `Copyright (c) 2013 David Foster` it is easier to demonstrate *willful* infringement when you sue someone for infringing your copyright. Willful infringment entitles the copyright owner to higher *damages* (i.e. payments from the infringer) than vanilla infringement.

### Copyright grants the author certain exclusive rights.

That is, other people don't get these rights. Such rights include (but are not limited to):

* The right to *distribute* the software, even for free.
* The right to *sell* the software.

But then you might ask how download sites like Download.com can operate: If by default only the original author has the right to distribute the software they create, a download site would need to get special permission (i.e. a *license*) to distribute most programs on their site, which would be time consuming (and therefore expensive).

In reality, download sites generally rely on software authors to not *enforce* their copyrights. Which brings us to another point:

### Copyrights are useless unless they are enforced.

Enforcement takes the form of the copyright holder actively looking for *infringers*: other people who are distributing or selling the software without permission.

For example, the MPAA may issue a DMCA takedown request to a YouTube user who has (without permission) posted an episode of a TV show that MPAA owns. If the user does not comply with the takedown, the MPAA may sue the user for infringement.

## Licenses

### A copyright holder may waive or share some rights by issuing a *license*.

Licenses may be issued to individuals or companies. For example  a particular distributor may be granted the right to market and sell the software on behalf of the original developer.[^app_store]

For open source software, licenses are typically granted to the community as a whole (i.e. every recipient of the program). This is typically done by including a file called `LICENSE` or `COPYING` with the software. A license may also be found in the software's `README`.

You can write your own custom license (if you feel comfortable writing in legalese). Or you can use one of the more common existing licenses from the community. (See [Common Licenses](#common_licenses) below for a list.)

[^app_store]: If you sell any apps on the App Store, you signed an agreement giving Apple such marketing rights.

### Dual Licensing

Sometimes the same piece of software is offered under multiple licenses.

For example the Qt GUI toolkit has been available under both the GPL license and (with payment) a commercial closed-source license for a long time. Since companies don't like basing their own closed source software on GPL-licensed original software, this gives them an option to use a more corporate-friendly commercial license.

When creating a new piece of software that is based on or uses dual-licensed software, you should document which license the original software is being used under.

If you are the original author of a piece of software, you can issue a new version of the software under additional licenses.

### Changing a Software's License

Under rare circumstances, the license provided with software can change.

As the copyright holder of a piece of software, you may decide to release a new version with a different set of licenses than prior versions. For example you could change the license offered from [BSD](#bsd) to [GPL](#gpl), a rather radical change. Such a change would only be in effect for the newly released version - it would have no effect on older released versions.

If you are not the copyright holder of a piece of software, you cannot change the license(s) under which it is offered.

If there are contributors beyond the original author whose changes have been incorporated into the software, they become partial copyright holders in the software as well unless they explicitly waive their copyright interests via a Contributor Agreeement or similar document. In the event of multiple copyright holders, all holders must agree to any proposed changes in the set of licenses under which the software is offered. Since there may be a large number of contributors (and thus copyright holders), it may be impossible to get permission from everyone, thereby making a license change infeasible.

Projects that are particularly aware of copyright concerns may require all contributors to sign a Contributor Agreement that either waives all copyright interests or explicitly assigns the copyright associated with all contributions to the original author.[^splunk_assignment]

[^splunk_assignment]: For example my present company Splunk requires that all contributors to its open source projects sign a Contributor Agreement of this type.

### No Warranty

All software licenses I have seen explicitly disclaim all warranties. Meaning that if the software harms someone, you can't sue the developer for it. This is great for software developers but in my opinion bad for society.

<a name="common_licenses"></a>
### Common Licenses

Here are the most common open source licenses, arranged generally from most permissive to most restrictive.

If you don't care about the details and only want to know when to use which license, skip to the [summary](#license_summary).

<a name="mit"></a>
#### Public Domain[^pub_domain] <small>&mdash; ultimately permissive</small>

* Do whatever you want with this software.
* This software cannot ever be placed under copyright or any license.

[^pub_domain]: Technically the state of being in the "public domain" is not a license. Any work explicitly released into the public domain is not subject to copyright law at all. In particular there is no copyright holder and can never be a copyright holder in the future.

<a name="mit"></a>
#### MIT License <small>&mdash; super permissive, simple</small>

* Do whatever you want with this software.

<a name="bsd"></a>
#### BSD License <small>&mdash; permissive, simple</small>

* You can redistribute this software.
* (Other rights are not expressedly waived.)
* There are several [variants](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BSD_licenses&oldid=539421860) of this license.

<a name="apache"></a>
#### Apache 2.0 License <small>&mdash; permissive, complex</small>

* You can do anything normally restricted by copyright.
* You can do anything normally restricted by patent rights.
* Redistribution must be done under certain terms.
* Submissions by contributors automatically fall under
  this license unless specified otherwise.
* You may NOT use trademarks related to this software
  (except in a few special cases).

<a name="lgpl"></a>
#### LGPL License 2.1 <small>&mdash; restrictive, complex</small>

* You can redistribute this software.
* You can modify this software and distribute the derived work. However the derived work must also be LGPL-licensed.
* You can relicense a copy of this software under the GPL. (This is an irreversible action for works derived from the new copy.)
* If you create your own software that uses this LGPL-software, the license of your source code is unaffected. However the resulting *executable* and (sometimes) the *object code* must satisfy the following terms:
    * Modification of the executable and object code is permitted for personal use.
    * Reverse engineering of the executable and object code is permitted.
    * You must give notice that the executable and object code uses this software and that this software is licensed under the LGPL. You must also provide a copy of the LGPL license text.
    * If the software displays copyright notices during its operation (such as in an About box), the LGPL copyright notice for this software must be included and a reference to the full LGPL license text must be provided.
    * Either:
        * (1) Include the source code for this software (including any modifications you made to it) when distributing the executable and object code.
        * (2) Require that the user of the executable or object code have this software installed locally already, and use shared library mechanisms to link the executable against the (unmodified) local copy of this software.
    * If distributing an executable, the nondistributed form of your software must include any data or utility programs necessary to compile the executable.[^include_utility_programs]

[^include_utility_programs]: At face value this doesn't actually seem like a restriction. However the LGPL text cautions, "It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute."

<a name="gpl"></a>
#### GPL License 2.0 <small>&mdash; restrictive, complex, "viral"</small>

* You can redistribute the source code of this software.
* You can modify this software and distribute the derived work.  However the derived work must also be GPL-licensed.[^gpl_ambiguous_derived]
* You can distribute this software or any software you create based on it, in executable or object code form, provided that you also distribute the corresponding source code (or provide a written offer to do so).

[^gpl_ambiguous_derived]: The GPL is ambiguous with respect to whether a piece of software that you create based on the GPL-licensed software (including merely linking to it) should be considered a derivative work or not. If so, then the GPL is truly "viral": any piece of code that interfaces with GPL-licensed software must also be licensed under the GPL. If not, the GPL still specifies unambiguously that programs based on GPL-licensed software must be distributed with all accompanying source code. Neither proposition is tolerable for most corporate software entities.

#### No License <small>&mdash; ultimately restrictive</small>

* You cannot redistribute or sell this software.
* You cannot create new software that is based on this software (i.e. derivative works).

<a name="license_summary"></a>
### Choosing a License

It is best to pick the license whose terms convey the message you want to send:

* **Public Domain**
    * Do anything you want with this software. It is free forever.
* **MIT**
    * Do anything you want with this software. (Although I might change my mind later.)
* **BSD (4-clause)**
    * Do anything you want with this software, although I want to be attributed (i.e. mentioned as the original author). But I don't want my name used to promote other things.
* **Apache**
    * You can do most things with this software.  
      (And my lawyers want a precise definition of what "most things" means.)
* **LGPL**
    * I want the source code for this software library (and any derived software) to be freely available forever. I also want to enforce that all improvements to this software library that are incorporated into other products be available for independent inspection.
    * I don't care if these extra terms made it burdensome for commercial entities to use my library, although I would like to make it possible for them to still use it if desired.
* **GPL**
    * I want the source code for this software library and any external software that uses it to be freely available forever.
    * I don't care if this means that my software will never be incorporated into a commercial product.
* **Copyright Notice; No License**
    * Don't even think about incorporating this software into another product, or selling it.
* **No Copyright Notice; No License**
    * I don't know about copyright or licenses. Ask me if you want to do something with my software.

Now that I've figured all of this out, it's time to update the licenses I'm using for [my own open source projects](https://github.com/davidfstr?tab=repositories).
Last week I decided to update one of my larger Python 2.7 projects to support Unicode fully
and to run under Python 3.

Here are the steps that I took and some gotchas I ran into along the way.

## General Strategy

Create and fully automate the unit test suite:

* This is important to detect any unexpected breakage from the Unicode-related changes you'll be making soon.
* Make sure your code coverage is good since tests can't protect you from mistakes introduced in uncovered code.

Identify all boundaries where data is being exchanged between the program and the outside environment. In my case:

* Direct I/O (i.e. `read` and `write`)
* Filesystem access (i.e. `open` and file paths)
* Process manipulation (via the `subprocess` module)
* Command-line arguments (via `sys.argv`)
* Time access (via the `time` module)

At boundaries:

* Reads should decode bytestrings to unicode using the proper encoding. You may need to do research to determine what the correct encoding is or how to determine the correct encoding at runtime.
    * Since my program did a lot of direct I/O on classic Mac OS data structures, the correct encoding was typically MacRoman.
    * `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` is sometimes appropriate. Be sure to test on Windows, where this value is typically not UTF-8.
* Writes should encode unicode (or ASCII bytestring literals) to bytestrings using the proper encoding.
* Ensure files and streams explicitly use either binary mode (i.e. `rb` or `wb`) or text mode (i.e. `rt` or `wt`).
    * UsuBytesIOally you want binary mode.
    * Text mode is required for certain cases, such as the output of the `json` module. Even then, it's a good idea to restrict text-based output to the ASCII character set since the native text encoding may not support the full Unicode set, particularly on Windows.

Finally:

* Run the `2to3` converter on your program so that it can be run by Python 3. 
* Run your new Python 3 source code in a Python 3 interpreter, perhaps inside a fresh Linux VM.
* Run your test suite under the Python 3 interpreter. It should find any Unicode mistakes that still need to be fixed.
* You will probably need to repeat this convert-test-fix cycle a couple of times.

## Special Cases

* Most uses of `StringIO` need to be migrated to `BytesIO`, when used as a byte buffer. If used as a string buffer, the `StringIO` uses need to be left at `StringIO`.
    * Here's the shim I used to support `BytesIO` and `StringIO` in both Python 2 and 3. I put it in a utility module and the rest of the program imports the shims instead of using the standard library.

<pre>
# BytesIO presents a stream interface to an in-memory bytestring.
# 
# This is equivalent to StringIO in Python 2 and to BytesIO in Python 3.
try:
    from io import BytesIO              # Python 3
except ImportError:
    from StringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

# StringIO presents a stream interface to an in-memory string
# (which is a bytestring in Python 2 and a unicode string in Python 3).
# 
# This is equivalent to StringIO in both Python 2 and 3.
try:
    from StringIO import StringIO
except ImportError:
    from io import StringIO             # Python 3
</pre>

* When writing to a binary stream, replace uses of `output.write(chr(byte_ordinal))` with `output.write(bchr(byte_ordinal))` and use the following shim for `bchr`:

<pre>
# bchr() converts the specified byte integer value to a single character
# bytestring.
# 
# This is equivalent to chr() in Python 2 but requires special handling in
# Python 3.
if bytes == str:
    def bchr(byte_ordinal):
        return chr(byte_ordinal)
else:
    def bchr(byte_ordinal):
        return bytes([byte_ordinal])    # Python 3
</pre>

* Beware of comparisons with `''`. Some of them probably need to be converted to comparisons with `b''`. For example, I had to adjust my `at_eof` utility function:

<pre>
def at_eof(input):
    """
    Returns whether the specified input stream is at EOF.
    """
    with save_stream_position(input):
        at_eof = input.read(1) == b''
    return at_eof
</pre>

* If your program uses human-readable ASCII bytestring literals, such as FourCC codes, make sure they are marked with the `b` prefix appropriately.

<pre>
if type_code == b'APPL':
</pre>

* Iteration over bytestrings works differently in Python 2 vs Python 3.
    * The code `for c in data:` will give back single-character bytestrings in Python 2 but byte ordinals in Python 3.
    * Here's my shim to let `for b in iterord(data):` always iterate over byte ordinals:

<pre>
# iterord() iterates over the integer values of the bytes in the specified
# bytestring.
if bytes == str:
    def iterord(bytes_value):           # Python 2
        for b in bytes_value:
            yield ord(b)
else:
    def iterord(bytes_value):           # Python 3
        return bytes_value
</pre>

* `time.strftime` returns a bytestring in Python 2 and a Unicode string in Python 3. Usually you want a Unicode string. I didn't create a shim for this since I only had one use of `strftime`.

<pre>
now_string = time.strftime('%b %d %H:%M', time.localtime(now))
if not isinstance(now_string, unicode):
    now_string = now_string.decode('ascii')
</pre>

* Regular expressions that are intended to apply to bytestrings instead of Unicode strings may need updating.
    * For example the pattern `re.compile(r'^Volume name is "(.*)"$')` which is designed to be applied to a MacRoman-encoded bytestring would need to be updated to read `re.compile(br'^Volume name is "(.*)"$')`

* Don't forget to update your documentation to specify where Unicode (or ASCII bytestring literals) are expected.It has been said that you can learn a lot from reading other people's high-quality software. So I gave it a try this weekend by reading the SQLite source.

SQLite is a lightweight embedded database that does not require a standalone server. It is designed to be reliable, highly portable, and require minimal administration.

SQLite has some of the [most rigorous testing methodology] I have seen in an open source project. Thus its true defect count is likely to be extremely low, making it high quality.

Such a high quality product probably contains useful patterns and techniques, some of which I could reuse in my own programs. So I decided to dive into the SQLite source and see what gems I could pull out. Here are my notes:

[most rigorous testing methodology]: https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html

## Architecture & Design

I started by reading the high-level design documentation. SQLite has exceptionally good documentation of this type.

* [Documentation Index] - *Root of all documentation.*

* [Architecture Documentation] - *Excellent overview of the architecture.*

* Query Planner Documentation - *Describes how prepared statements are executed.*
    * [The Virtual Database Engine]
    * [Virtual Machine Opcodes]

### Internal Tools of Note

#### [Fossil]

Distributed version control system used by SQLite. I've never heard of this. Beyond version control also provides bug tracking, a wiki, and a blog.

#### [Lemon]

A custom parser generator used by SQLite. Alternative to the old bison/yacc combination which has some improvements:

* Syntax that is less error-prone.
* Fast. Reentrant. Thread-safe.
* Easier to write parsers that avoid leaking memory upon error conditions.
    * Important since SQLite is serious about handling out of memory conditions.

#### [VFS]

OS abstraction layer. Despite the acronym (Virtual Filesystem), it is more than just filesystem manipulation routines.

## Implementation Notes

### table.c (sqlite3_get_table)

* This is the main entry point into the SQLite API.
  It executes a SQL statement and returns the result.

* First impression is that most methods have a lot of malloc-failed handling. And indeed if you read the testing procedures, they involve causing random malloc errors throughout the code, so there has to be handling for such errors.

* Hungarion notation is used as well. Ick. But at least it is consistent.
    * z = string
    * a = array
    * p = object pointer
    * n = int
    * x = function pointer

* `/* Assume 32-bit assignment is atomic */`
    * Interesting that such a property would be *consciously* relied on.

### legacy.c (sqlite3_exec)

* This is the legacy entry point into the SQLite API.
  It still exists and is actually used internally by the currently
  recommended API entry point (`sqlite3_get_table`).

* There are some odd syntactic conventions.
    * Multi-line comments use double-stars to prefix middle lines.
    * No space before closing `{`.
    * Spaces inside outer parentheses for most statements
      (`if`, `while`, `assert`) but not all (`for`).

* It appears that functions that begin with `sqlite3_` are public,
  whereas functions starting with `sqlite3` (no underscore) are private.


### vdbeapi.c (sqlite3_step)

* This function executes one or more instructions from the instruction list
  inside of a prepared SQL statement. The instruction is executed inside
  of the SQLite virtual database engine (VDBE), which is a virtual machine.
    * It has a lot of support code for EXPLAIN and profiling callbacks.
    * The meat of instruction execution is done by `sqlite3VdbeExec`.

* Contains own mutex implementation. (`sqlite3_mutex_enter`)

* Deals with a somewhat crazy circumstance: If the database schema changes
  in the middle of executing a (prepared) SQL statement, the statement is
  reprepared and rerun automatically.

* Generally there is good commenting for weird and backward-compatibility
  behaviors.

* Practically every function can fail. They all return an integer error code.
    * Some functions that operate on an in-out data structure will
      additionally store an error code (and message) in that structure.

### vdbe.c (sqlite3VdbeExec)

* This function executes as many instructions as possible from a prepared
  SQL statement. It contains the monsterous switch statement that 
  enumerates every possible opcode that can be executed.
    * Related reference documentation: [Virtual Machine Opcodes]
    * Related guide documentation: [The Virtual Database Engine]

### Future

* If I were to continue reading into the implementation,
  I think the opcodes that manipulate B-trees would likely be
  the most interesting ones to look at.

## Summary

This is a very high-quality C library.

* Internal commenting is good.
* Consistent syntax is used, despite being a bit odd IMHO.
* The guide-level documentation is wonderful.
* Error handling is air-tight and enforced by crazy amounts of test code. 
* The architecture provides good separation of roles and is easy to understand.
* Once again, the documentation is excellent.

And its design requirements show through in the implementation:

**Reliable**

* There is more than 1000 times as much test code as there is product code.
* 100% branch coverage. That's insanely good.
* Very crazy error classes such as out of memory errors, crashes, integer overflow are all considered and tested for.
    * Malloc checks are prevalent and handled.
    * Transactions, journaling, and related testing deal with crashes.

**Portable**

* The chosen language is C, which is highly portable when written in the appropriate style.
* The so-called VFS layer provides an OS abstraction. Thus porting to an OS mainly just involves writing a new implementation of this abstraction.
* All C files are combined into one giant C file before being sent to the compiler, which provides for better compile-time optimizations for dumber C compilers, which may occur on embedded systems.
* The database format does not depend on endianness or native data type sizes, making it suitable for cross-platform use.
* Very low memory configurations are available, making SQLite suitable for use on embedded devices such as cellphones.
* The code is in the public domain, which removes any licensing barriers.

**Simple**

* SQLite is embedded into the program that uses it, requiring no separate server. And no administration for such a server.
* Minimal schema is imposed by SQLite, distinguishing only between integers, reals, text, and blobs at a low level. And even so, a column's type is advisory only - you can store a value of any type in any column (except an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` column).

Of course being simple sacrifices certain other properties such as high concurrency and the ability to perform fine-grained access control (which requires administrability).

[Virtual Machine Opcodes]: http://www.sqlite.org/opcode.htmlI've been using [BBEdit] as my primary text editor on the Mac for over 10 years. It is an extremely capable and mature editor with just about all the bells and whistles you can imagine. However the use of Sublime Text has been spreading throughout my workplace at Splunk[^splunk] so I decided I'd give it a try.

My initial impression was "BBEdit can do everything that Sublime can, what's the deal?" But after using Sublime full-time for about a week, I'm starting to come around to it.

Although it is true that both have comparable feature sets, Sublime's implementation feels more polished - not just eyecandy, but actually better usability.

* Incremental find
    * As you start typing the substring you want to find, it automatically starts searching within the current document. Frequently you don't have to finish typing the substring in order to get the result you want.
    * This saves a surprising amount of time compared to BBEdit where you have to finish providing a full substring (that you think is long enough) before kicking off the search.
    * **Edit:** *This is actually available in BBEdit under the "Live Search" command, but this is not part of the default Find experience and not advertised.*
* View a file without "opening" it (as a persistent tab)
    * Sublime keeps files of current interest available as tabs in the main window. If you just click on a file, it is shown in the editor but no tab is created by default. If you decide this is an important file, you can double-click on the file name to create an actual tab for it, which makes the file easy to return to.
        * Most "Goto X" actions in Sublime both show a file and create an actual tab for it, which usually is what you want.
    * If you click on any file at all in BBEdit, it is "opened" and added to the "Currently Open Documents" section, which is analogous to Sublime's set of open tabs. This can result in the "Currently Open Documents" section getting rather cluttered when rummaging around for a particular document, making it less useful.
* Minidocument view on the right side of an open file.
    * This makes it easier to get a bird's eye view of where you are in a long function or file.

Additionally, Sublime's marketing has some a much better job of exposing advanced features that turn out to be useful in daily use.

* "Goto Anything"
    * BBEdit has similar "Open File by Name", but it's slower, doesn't have as expressive syntax, and isn't incremental.
* "Open Folder"
    * This is equivalent to a BBEdit project.
* Plugins!
    * This is barely advertised on the BBEdit side but hugely promoted on the Sublime side. Thus lots of people are writing (publicly available) plugins for Sublime but not so many for BBEdit.

Some features in Sublime are named more obviously:

* Convert Indentation to Spaces. Convert Indentation to Tabs.
    * BBEdit calls these operations "Detab" and "Entab" respectively.

Some features in Sublime are easier to access:

* Change the displayed tab width.
    * To change this for a single file in BBEdit, you have to go to "Show Fonts", which I find completely nonintuitive.
    * BBEdit also allows you to change the default tab spacing *per source language* in its preferences, which makes sense given that different languages have different conventions.
    * However BBEdit does not permit you to change the tab width on a per project/folder basis, which is usually what you want when working on someone else's open source project.
* Access the function list. ("Goto Symbol...")
    * This can be done in Sublime entirely through the keyboard.

Sublime also has a few features lacking in BBEdit:

* Cross-platform support
    * This is huge when working in a mixed OS environment. You can use the same editor everywhere.

BBEdit still is better in a few areas:

* Can edit preferences in a GUI without mucking about in text files.
* Can quickly split a single file vertically to edit distant sections simultaneously.
* "Zap Gremlins..."
    * Deletes or replaces ASCII control characters and other nasties. Very useful for text pasted from web browsers, Word, or other less-than-pure sources of text.
* "Process Duplicate Lines..."
    * Eliminate duplicate lines in a file. This is often useful after performing a series of text transformations.
* "Process Lines Containing..."
    * Delete (or preserve) all lines containing a subexpression. Exactly like the `grep` command-line tool.
* Can edit files on an FTP/SFTP server directly.
* Customer support I've heard is top-notch.

I think I'm going to continue using Sublime Text. Featurewise it's about the same as BBEdit, but the cross-platform support[^cross-plat], active plugin community, and general polish <!-- & attention to usability --> are winning me over.

[BBEdit]: http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html

[^splunk]: Splunk makes tools for analyzing large time-series datasets, such as log files. For details see the 3 minute [Splunk Product Overview](http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAHG6). I work on the Developer Platform, making it easy for other developers to build neat things on top of the Splunk core.

[^cross-plat]: It is extremely useful to be able to use the same full-featured text editor on any platform I use. I currently maintain a few open source projects that require testing, debugging, and development on multiple platforms (notably the [RDiscount](/projects/rdiscount/) Markdown processor) and it's nice being able to use the same editor everywhere.**p4status** works like `git status` (or `svn status`), but works in Perforce.

It will list changelist files and locally modified files that haven't been added to any changelist (including unadded files) in a readable format.

<div style="padding: .8em 1em .8em; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 1px solid #94da3a;">
    <p style="font-weight: bold; color: #487858;">
        Note
    </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0em;">
        The 2012 version of Perforce has an official
        <b>p4 status</b> command. However this command is only available if 
        your corporate Perforce server has been upgraded to 2012. If your 
        company, like mine, has not upgraded their server, this script will 
        make your life easier.
    </p>
</div>

### Example

<pre>
[dfoster ~/dev/p4/mybranch/path/to/myproject]$ p4status
# On changelist 154055
# 
# Changes to be committed in changelist default:
#   (use "p4 revert <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
# 
#       deleted:    server/apps/setupfx/splunkd/default/extract.conf
# 
# Changes to be committed in changelist 154076:
#   (use "p4 revert <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
# 
#       new file:   server/apps/setupfx/splunkd/default/inputs-NEW.conf
#       modified:   server/apps/setupfx/splunkd/default/inputs.conf
# 
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "p4 add/edit/delete <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "p4 sync -f <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
# 
#       new file:   server/apps/setupfx/splunkd/default/inputs-NEW2.conf
# 
</pre>

### Installation

* Download to your local `bin` directory:
  <https://github.com/davidfstr/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/p4status>
* Mark as executable with `chmod a+x p4status`

### Usage

* `cd` to the primary directory that you'll be working under.
* Run `p4status`.

### Limitations

* Only detects unstaged files under the directory in which the command is run. Therefore it is best to reserve a terminal window that is `cd`-ed to the correct place where this command can be run safely.

* This command is too slow to run from the root of very large branches.

### Alternatives

* Use the excellent Git-to-Perforce bridge, [git-p4].
    * This allows you to work with your Perforce repository as if it were a Git repository. And you can use Git's very fast `git status` command.
* Convince your Perforce server administrator to upgrade to the 2012 version. This may take some time, depending on the size of your company.

[git-p4]: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-p4A *killer app* is any product that is so desirable that it fuels the sale/adoption of a larger technology that the product depends on.

The gaming industry has been aware of the power of killer apps for a while, and often seeks to create launch titles for their new gaming systems that are killer apps. Microsoft, for example, deliberately created the first Halo game at same time as their Xbox console. And Nintendo has repeatedly introduced new Mario titles with its new consoles.

<!-- Similarly, some of the classic examples of killer apps were the first entrants in new software categories: word processors (WordStar) and spreadsheets (VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3). -->

However what may not be so obvious is that killer apps exist for learning new software platforms as well, such as for APIs, SDKs, and programming languages.

Learning a new platform (along with the associated tools and ecosystem) takes a large investment of *time*, and so there is a similar barrier to adoption as, say, the monetary cost of buying a new game console.

I think the platform-builders in the software industry could learn from the gaming industry and strategically introduce killer apps alongside new platform offerings.  I can think of no prior case where this was done deliberately (see the Appendix below), so I think our industry (i.e. software) is really missing out.

[^outlook]: Although Microsoft has finally created a version of Outlook for the Mac, it is buggy and missing a number of advanced features of the Windows version. Thus two of my colleagues <!-- Neeraj and Dee --> who do a lot of planning run Outlook specifically on Windows despite the workplace being otherwise Mac-oriented.Generally [Racket] appears to be a very usable dialect of Lisp/Scheme.

Racket is particularly well suited for those who want to develop their own programming language (including those not based on S-expressions), given that the creators of Racket are programming language researchers. For example, a number of Racket subsets have been created to assist students who are learning Racket/Scheme via the [How to Design Programs] book.[^Racket-subsets] The Arc language by Paul Graham is also implemented in the Racket environment.

Racket's developers wanted to make sure it was a *practical* language. To that end, there is a bundled IDE (DrRacket) with syntax highlighting, parentheses matching, and integrated debugging. There is also a package management system (PLaneT).[^import-planet] And built-in libraries for working with several real-world systems, such as GUIs, networking, databases, JSON/XML, etc. A cross-platform executable can easily be built. And everything is well documented.

Graphics and GUI programs are supported better than the average language. For example pictures are rendered natively in the Racket REPL, including their use within expressions. And the built-in Racket GUI library is fairly decent.

The combination of a decent built-in GUI library along with the ability to compile cross-platform executables makes Racket useful for writing cross-platform GUI applications.

## Racket's GUI library (RacketGUI)

The original version of Racket's GUI library was implemented on top of wxWidgets.[^gui-rewrite] Thus some of wxWidget's poor design decisions leak through:

* A visual component is called a "window", not a control.
* Visual components must be associated with their parent container at creation time.

However, some fixes were made too:

* There is no notion of a wxWidgets "sizer" as distinct from a "container window".
    * This simplifies the mental model considerably, since it is no longer necessary to keep track of both a "window" hierarchy and a sizer hierarchy.
    * Instead, a wxWidgets "sizer" is represented as a lightweight RacketGUI "pane", which can be nested naturally inside containers along with other components.
* The event handling loop is managed in the background automatically.

Sadly, RacketGUI lacks some advanced controls I often want:

* trees
* tables containing controls in cells
    * However the `list-box%` control supports cells that only contain text.
* tree-tables

This is not surprising since these controls are hard to implement and are not well-supported by the original underlying wxWidgets library:

* The wxWidgets tree interface (wxTreeCtrl) is annoying for dynamically generated trees.
* Tables (wxListCtrl) only support text and image cells, not controls as cells.

[How to Design Programs]: http://htdp.org
[^Racket-subsets]: The [HtDP](http://htdp.org) book uses the dialects "Beginning Student", "Intermediate Student", and "Advanced Student". These sublanguages restrict the use of certain language features (such as using functions as objects) and can provide better error messages (which avoid mentioning advanced features not supported by the sublanguage).
[^gui-rewrite]: Racket's GUI layer has apparently been redone a couple of times. Originally it was based on wxWidgets. Later it was rewritten to about 200,000 lines of C++ glue to Xt, Win32, and Carbon. Then in Racket 5.1 it was replaced with about 80,000 lines of Racket glue to Gtk, Win32, Cocoa, Cairo, and Pango. That's a 60% reduction in code! More details on the [Racket blog](http://blog.racket-lang.org/2010/12/racket-version-5.html).## What is Prolog?

Prolog is a declarative programming language that, given a list of axioms and a list of implication rules, can deduce the truth (or falsehood) of a logical statement.

For example, given the following knowledge base (AKA *database*):

<pre>
% Axiom: Mary likes Ted.
likes(mary,ted).
% Axiom: Jane likes Ted.
likes(jane,ted).
% Rule: X is jealous of Y if they both like Z (and are not the same person).
jealous(X,Y) :- likes(X,Z), likes(Y,Z), X \= Y.
</pre>

I can ask the question `jealous(mary,jane)` and get the affirmation `true`.
Or I can ask the question `jealous(mary,mary)` and get the denial `false`.[^period-question]

I can also ask a more complicated question containing variables and Prolog will derive the possible values (and relations) the variables must have in order to make the question posed to be true.

For example, asking the question `jealous(X,Y)` will give the results:

<pre>
X = mary,
Y = jane ;
X = jane,
Y = mary
</pre>

As another (more interesting) example, consider the knowledge base:

<pre>
% Rule: A line is horizontal if its points have the same Y coordinate.
horizontal(line( point(_,Y), point(_,Y) )).
% Rule: A line is vertical if its points have the same X coordinate.
vertical(line( point(X,_), point(X,_) )).
</pre>

And the questions:

<pre>
(1) horizontal(line( point(0,0), point(X,Y) )).  ==>  Y = 0.
(2) horizontal(line( point(0,0), P2 )).          ==>  P2 = point(_G327, 0).
</pre>

The second question is particularly interesting because it gave back a fairly complicated answer: `P2` must be a `point`, its X coordinate can be anything, but its Y coordinate must be zero. I think it's particularly cool that Prolog can deduce that P2 must be a point. <!-- LPN §2.1 -->

As a final example of a simple problem solvable by Prolog, consider the [crossword puzzle] in Exercise 2.4 of "Learn Prolog Now!". You can write a Prolog program to solve crossword puzzles!

[^period-question]: When posing a question in the Prolog interpreter, you must include a trailing period at the end of the question.

[crossword puzzle]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse7


## When is Prolog useful?

Prolog's deduction capabilities makes it useful for answering questions and making deductions within systems whose concepts can be expressed in a formal hierarchy. <!-- LPN §2.1 -->

In academia, for example, Prolog has been used to investigate natural language formalizations and expert systems in artificial intelligence. <!-- LPN §2.1 -->

### Case Study: Java bytecode verifier

As a more practical example, Prolog has also been used to define the semantics of the Java bytecode verifier[^java-verifier] for Java 6.[^cite-java-prolog] Prior versions of Java had a verifier whose semantics were defined by a textual specification only (namely the Java Virtual Machine Specification).

There are a few advantages to having the verifier defined in terms of Prolog:

* The specification becomes formal (and thereby unambiguous and more likely to be error-free).
* The execution model for performing the verification becomes well-defined (since it would use Prolog's) and fast (since Prolog's core unification algorithm is fast<!-- LPN §2.1 -->).

[^java-verifier]: The job of the Java bytecode verifier is to examine a compiled Java program and check whether it is well-structured and therefore (reasonably) safe for the Java virtual machine to execute. For example the verifier would reject a Java program containing a command to jump to an instruction location outside of the current method.

[^cite-java-prolog]: See the [Java Virtual Machine Specification](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/index.html). Particularly "Preface to the Java SE 7 Edition" and §4.10 "Verification of class Files".


## Writing Programs

### Functions as Rules

So how do you actually write something resembling a *program* in Prolog? Until now we've been talking about axioms, rules, and questions. But in most languages a program consists of a series of expressions that are evaluated.

For example in Python, you might write:

<pre>
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

print add(5, 3)    # prints 8
</pre>

In Prolog, you can do something similar by defining a rule where one of the variables in the rule (typically the last one) is its "output":

<pre>
add(X, Y, Result) :- Result is X + Y.
</pre>

To actually evaluate this "function" with 5 and 3 you would ask the question `add(5, 3, Result)` which would yield `Result = 8`.

Now, don't get trapped into the idea that such as rule always needs to be evaluated in one direction. In Prolog you have the additional power to ask what the "inputs" of the function has to be to yield an already-known "output".

For example, you could ask the question `add(X, 3, 8)` to deduce that "input" X must be 5.[^is-problems] You could even try asking `add(X, Y, 8)` to find all values of X and Y that yield 8 as a result (although there are an infinite number of such combinations in this example).[^collecting-solutions]

This power to flip functions on their head is a unique quality of Prolog. (And it blows my mind.)

Ultimately a rule specifies a set of relationships between its arguments. Thus arguments can be "inputs", "outputs", or even temporary variables (like accumulators).

[^is-problems]: Unfortunately the `is` clause in this example cannot be run "backwards", so this particular question will fail. (I am not sure why this particular restriction on `is` exists.)

[^collecting-solutions]: A Prolog *program* that wanted to collect all combinations of inputs in this fashion (as opposed to a user at the interpreter) would probably use a combination of the `findall`, `bagof`, and `setof` special rules. See [LPN §11.2 "Collecting Solutions"](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse49) for more information.

### Processing Recursive Data Structures

Processing recursive data structures such as lists and trees is mind bending... For examples see:

* [LPN §6.1 "Append"] and
* [LPN §6.2 "Reversing a List"].

[LPN §6.1 "Append"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse24
[LPN §6.2 "Reversing a List"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse25


## Interactive Use (as a REPL)

It is possible to run Prolog in an interactive fashion by using the `assert` special rule at runtime to define new statements (i.e. axioms and rules). And `listing` will display the set of statements that have been defined. Finally `retract` and `retractall` can be used to undefine statements.

These special rules, however, are not restricted to use in the interpreter - they can also be used at runtime by rules in programs. For example memoization[^memo] is a good use for dynamic calls to `assert`.

[LPN §2.2 "Proof Search"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse6
[LPN §2.4 "Practical Session"]: http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse8

[^memo]: Memoization is where a function that computes a value caches the result of the computation so that repeated invocations with the same input can immediately return the saved result. This can speed of performance in certain applications. See [LPM §11.1 "Database Manipulation"](http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pagetype=html&pageid=lpn-htmlse48) for an example.


## Question Evaluation <small>(Unification, Backtracking)</small>

When evaluating a question, Prolog takes the question expression and matches it against the axioms and rules in the input knowledge base. The algorithm used for matching is called *unification*. While performing unification, Prolog makes guesses about what values should be assigned to each variable in the question expression. If it encounters a contradiction, it *backtracks* to one of its previous guesses and revises the guess. This process is described graphically in [LPN §2.2 "Proof Search"].

Although Prolog is a declarative language, the precise behavior of evaluating queries depends on the order that rules and clauses are defined. In particular the performance of the same program can vary significantly depending on ordering. As another gotcha, if you define rules in a left-recursive fashion (as opposed to a right-recursive one), Prolog will go into an infinite loop when evaluating the rule.

It is possible to debug (and step through) the evaluation of a question expression using the **trace** command, which is described in [LPN §2.4 "Practical Session"]. This is useful for investigating performance issues.

### Cuts

It is possible to optimize the execution of a Prolog rule by adding a **cut** as a clause. This is written as a bang (`!`). Unfortunately to use cuts effectively (and correctly), you have to understand the exact execution model used by Prolog. It is quite easy to unwittingly insert a cut that actually changes the semantics of the original rule. <!-- LPN §10.1, §10.2 -->

There are even hacks you can do with cuts such as implementing "negation as failure" (`\+`). But again you have to be very careful since cuts can change your knowledge base's semantics. <!-- LPN §10.3 -->


## Side Effects & I/O

Some built-in clauses trigger side effects when they are examined by the unification algorithm. Programs take advantage of such "impure predicates" to do I/O and other types of side-effecting work.

For example asking the question `print('Hello')` will print `Hello` to the screen.[^str-symbol]

To write to a file you might define:

<pre>
printfile(Filename, Text) :-
    open(Filename, write, Stream),
    write(Stream, Text), nl(Stream),
    close(Stream).
</pre>

And then pose the question `printfile('hogwarts.txt', 'Hogwarts')`.

During evaluation, the `printfile` is rewritten to `open(...) AND write(...) AND nl(...) AND close(...)`. Each of those subclauses is then each evaluated to `true` (performing the associated side effect) and the overall clause becomes just `true`.

[^str-symbol]: Note that `'Hello'` (with single quotes) is a variable, not a string. The string `"Hello"` (with double quotes) is equivalent to a list of codepoints (`[72, 101, 108, 108, 111]`).

Recently I took the liberty of reading one of the defining books in the domain of computer science: [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][sicp], often abbreviated as SICP.

SICP is the computer science textbook given to undergraduates at MIT. It serves as an advanced text on software design and as an introductory text for the Lisp programming language.

Here are some interesting things I learned:

## Role of Programming Languages

Languages should:

* provide the means for **combining simple ideas to form complex ideas**,
* provide the means for **abstracting units of computation**, and
* serve as a framework within which we **organize our ideas about processes**.

Units of computation can be abstracted in several forms:

* **procedure** - *Assigns names to common patterns, allowing you to work in terms of the named abstractions directly.*
    * AKA function, method
* **abstract data type** - *Allows the choice of representation (i.e. the implementation) to vary separately from the API (i.e. the interface).*[^impl-vs-interface]
    * Built-in language support is often provided in the form of **classes**.
    * See also: LISP constructors
        * AKA **constructor** or **static factory method** in other languages
    * See also: LISP selectors
        * AKA **accessors**, mutators, or **properties** in other languages
* **module**[^mod-asm] - *Groups several procedures and data types into a namespace independent from other modules.*
    * AKA package (Java), namespace (C++), module (Python)
    * Languages that don't have built-in support for this concept typically use prefixes to create de-facto namespaces. (C, Objective-C, PHP < 5.3.0)
* **assembly** - *Groups several modules together in a single versioned [^versioning] package. Assemblies can depend on other assemblies, often from separate vendors.*
    * AKA **shared library** (C, C++), gem (Ruby), egg (Python)

[^impl-vs-interface]: For example, complex numbers can be expressed in rectangular (a + b*i*) or polar form (r*cos(𝜽)). -- Some representations are better than others for different operations. Adding works better in rectangular form. Multiplying works better in polar form.

[^versioning]: Versioning assemblies effectively is a challenging topic onto itself. If done without care you get so-called "dependency hell". Just getting a consistent version numbering scheme can be tricky. One popular versioning scheme is codified as [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

[^mod-asm]: SICP does not mention the notion of a *module* or an *assembly*, however these are common higher-level units for abstracting computation in languages other than Lisp.

<a id="abstract-data-types"></a>
## Abstract Data Types

<a id="lisp-vs-pascal-design-philosophies"></a>
### Lisp vs. Pascal Design Philosophies

*For you youngin's that have never used Pascal, just replace "Pascal" with "Java" in this section and you should get the right idea.*

Two design philosophies:

* **Lisp-school**: Create abstract data types by combining a *small* set of general-purpose data types (particularly collections). These complex structures can then be manipulated using operations on these general-purpose types.

    * *"Lisp is for building organisms -­ imposing, breathtaking, dynamic structures built by squads fitting fluctuating myriads of simpler organisms into place."*
    
    * *"Lisp programs inflate libraries with functions whose utility transcends the application that produced them."*


* **Pascal-school**: Create *many* special-purpose data types (i.e. classes) and specialized operations to manipulate them.

    * *"Pascal is for building pyramids -­ imposing, breathtaking, static structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place."*
    
    * *"In Pascal the plethora of declarable data structures induces a specialization within functions that inhibits and penalizes casual cooperation."*

Roughly speaking, I think of the Lisp philosophy as **programming with collections** and the Pascal philosophy as **programming with classes**.[^nonviable]

#### Usage

The Pascal philosophy has won out in most statically typed languages such as C++ and Java, and in languages with poor (or nonexistent) built-in collections.

The Lisp philosophy is more common in dynamically typed languages that lack built-in support for classes, such as Lisp itself and JavaScript.

A hybrid approach (using both philosophies) is seen in languages that are dynamically typed, have built-in collections, and have built-in classes, such as Python and Ruby.

[^nonviable]: In my opinion, a language that supports neither first-class collections nor first-class classes is non-viable for large scale general purpose software development. C, Assembly, and Fortran fall into this category.

<a id="polymorphism"></a>
### Polymorphism

Polymorphism is where multiple abstract data types implement a common *interface*, which is typically defined as a series of methods that can be called on all implementing types.

This allows client code, when given an object known only to implement a particular interface, to invoke interface methods on the object and end up calling the correct implementation of that method depending on the runtime type of the object.

#### Implementation Strategies

Polymorphism can be implemented in several different ways:

* **Switch on Typecode**
    * Easiest to implement. Hardest to maintain.
    * Treated as an anti-pattern in many OO languages.
* **Virtual Lookup Tables**
    * AKA "data-directed programming" (in SICP) or v-tables (C++)
    * Default implementation strategy for most OO languages.
* **Message Passing**
    * Most flexible.

Many languages provide a *default implementation strategy* as a language construct. For example C++ and Java use virtual lookup tables. Smalltalk and Objective-C use message passing. C doesn't give you anything for free, so you have to roll your own polymorphism.

#### Tradeoffs

These implementation strategies for polymorphism have some tradeoffs, which are worth knowing:

* Virtual lookup tables are restricted in that *the total set of operations on the abstract data type must be known in advance*.
* Message passing, on the other hand, can be made more flexible: 
    * Implementing data types may choose to support more operations than the standard set on the interface.[^vfs]
    * Heck, individual *instances* can choose to support more operations than the standard set.
        * In such cases, you would want to interrogate (i.e. reflect on) an individual instance to determine what operations (i.e. messages) it understands/supports.

[^vfs]: For example, the Linux virtual filesystem, which is implemented in message-passing style, has a common set of operations that all filesystems are expected to support (ex: `unlink`). However individual filesystems may support additional operations: For example the HFS+ filesystem on Mac OS X additionally supports a `delete` operation, which has slightly different semantics than the standard `unlink` operation.

<a id="cross-type-operations"></a>
### Cross-Type Operations

Introducing **cross-type operations**, such as `add(Integer, Complex)`, is a very tricky design issue.

Having explicit functions that operate on all combinations of types is possible but highly verbose. With **n** types and **m** operations, you need <strong>n*m</strong> functions to implement all combinations. Impractical.

Another strategy is to use *coercion* to convert a value from one type to another. So instead of defining `add(Integer, Complex)`, just define `convertToComplex(Integer) : Complex`, and use the existing `add(Complex, Complex)`. To convert between all types requires at least **n** but no more than **n<sup>2</sup>** conversion functions.

Many programming languages have built-in facilities to automatically coerce types. For some languages (like JavaScript or PHP) these coersion rules are quite complex (and error-prone). Other languages (like ML) ban implicit coercion entirely.

* Java only has coercion for built-in types.
* C++ lets the datatype designer choose (via `implicit` or explicit one-argument constructors).
* Scala relies on implicit coercion a lot to enable foreign methods to be introduced on types.

One wrinkle is that these conversion functions might introduce a loss in precision. For example not every integer can be represented as double of exactly the same value.

<a id="assignments-mutable-state-and-side-effects"></a>
## Assignments, Mutable State, and Side Effects

Introducing assignment creates lots of complications. In particular *referential transparency* is lost. Optimizations related to reordering and coalescing expressions need to be a lot more careful. Static reasoning of various kinds is impaired.

To reduce bugs it is best to minimize the use of mutation by using immutable objects whenever possible.[^large-structs]

Haskell takes a very aggressive stance against assignments, mutable state, and other side effects: they are banned by default. However Haskell does allow side effects within the context of a **monad**. This is a special construct unique to Haskell (so far as I know).

[^large-structs]: A common case where eliminating mutation may *not* be practical is when defining and working with large data structures that need many small updates made to them over time. If such a structure were made immutable, there would be a large performance penalty for recopying the entire structure whenever a small change needed to be made.

<a id="lazy-evaluation"></a>
### Lazy Evaluation

Normally expressions are evaluated immediately, in the order that they occur in code. **Lazy evaluation** changes this behavior such that expressions are only evaluated when some primitive operation (like print or add) requires the value of the expression. Until then the unevaluated expression is passed around (as a "thunk").

Lazy evaluation enables that creation of **lazy data structures**, which is a useful performance optimization in some contexts.

Unrestricted mutation and lazy evaluation do not mix well in programming languages. Since unrestricted mutation is very common in mainstream programming languages, it is quite rare to be in an environment that supports lazy evaluation. Haskell is one of the few.

<a id="declarative-languages"></a>
## Declarative Languages

Logic programming languages are at the far declarative end of the
imperative-declarative spectrum. They can be used to deduce answers
from a set of initial set of declarative statements.

[Prolog] is the best-known example of a logic programming language.

Query systems for databases are a type of logic programming language.

A "query" (i.e. an expression in the language) is transformed into a
"query plan" (i.e. a specific set of steps to follow) by a query planner. The implemented of these planners is quite complex.

[Prolog]: /articles/2013/02/25/notes-on-prolog/

<a id="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion

So those are a few interesting things I learned from reading SICP. Taking notes while reading made it a lot easier for me to remember the content. You might try it when reading a technical book with a lot of new concepts.

I like learning new languages to get myself to think about problems in different ways.

Here's a list of a few well-known languages I've worked with and some of the more interesting features I've encountered:

### C

* **Undefined behavior**
    * The idea that a language specification would explicitly specify certain constructs as having undefined behavior is interesting. Most specifications leave things undefined by omission, not commission.
    * Although this allows various compiler optimizations, many developers rely on their particular compiler's implementation of undefined behavior without even realizing it.[^overflow]

[^overflow]: For example it is undefined what happens when you add to an integer variable and the variable overflows. In most compilers adding 1 to the largest integer wraps around to result in the smallest integer, and thus a number of programs depend on this behavior. Other compilers [assume overflow is impossible](http://thiemonagel.de/2010/01/signed-integer-overflow/).

### Java

* **Objects are the primary unit of composition**
    * There are no standalone functions.
    * Design Patterns can be used to describe high level object coordination patterns.
    * However sometimes the community's focus on objects can be a bit extreme[^java-rant].
* **Checked exceptions**
    * Great when used *sparingly*, as it forces the caller to handle expected error conditions.    
        * I do think that it was a usability error to make `Exception` checked and `RuntimeException` unchecked. Rather it should be `Exception` that is *unchecked* and a new `CheckedException` should be the base for all checked exceptions. This makes it clear that *unchecked* exceptions should be the default.
    * Managing checked exceptions *correctly* is quite difficult. <!-- TODO: ARTICLE-IDEA -->
* **Unicode strings**
    * Tons of other languages use "bytestrings" as the main string type which causes all kinds of problems when working with international characters. <!-- TODO: ARTICLE-IDEA -->
* **Documentation focus**
    * Every library is expected to have JavaDoc documentation, which is generated from documentation comments in the source
    * This is really powerful, since it makes it easy for developers to write documentation, and to do so at the same time the implementation is coded, when the desired behavior is most fresh in the mind.
* **Compatibility focus**
    * I have never seen a community so focused on maintaining backward compatibility. I can't think of a single deprecated method in the Java library that was actually deleted.
    * Even the Java Language Specification has an entire chapter devoted to [binary compatibility](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se5.0/html/binaryComp.html).
    * This focus may be partially attributable to the early mantra of [Write once, run anywhere][wora].
* **Garbage Collection**
    * Being freed from the confines of manual memory management makes it a ton easier to focus on more important things.

[^java-rant]: Steve Yegge has a great rant on the over-focus on objects in the Java community: [Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html)

[wora]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere

### C&#35;

Very similar to Java.[^java-copycat]

* **Assemblies**
    * This is a level of encapsulation above the typical namespaces or modules in most languages. Assemblies are similar to the idea of static/dynamic libraries in C or JAR files in Java.
    * Notably, you can mark members as `internal`, which makes them public within the same assembly, but private to everybody outside the assembly. This is quite useful.
* **Cross-language compatibility is first-class** (not just for C)
    * C# runs in the Common Language Runtime, which was designed from the beginning to support interoperability between languages.
* **Properties are first-class**
    * No longer need to write explicit getter and (optional) setter methods.
* **Listeners are first-class**
    * Classes can declare an *event* `Foo` with `addFooListener` and `removeFooListener` functionality built in.
    * Unfortunately the implementation has some annoyances[^event-flaw].
* **Foreign Methods[^foreign-method] are first-class**
    * C# calls these *extension methods*.
* **Partial Classes**
    * Allows a class's members to be defined in multiple files.
    * Useful to add functionality to a generated class (for example, from a parser generator) without those modifications getting lost when the class is next regenerated.

[^java-copycat]: C# is by design almost a direct copy of Java. It amazes me that Microsoft (C#'s sponsor) would spend so much effort making a copy of an existing language.

[^foreign-method]: I am referring to the [Foreign Method](http://www.refactoring.com/catalog/introduceForeignMethod.html) design pattern here, not a native function from a [foreign function interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface).

[^event-flaw]: If you invoke an uninitialized event-property, it will throw a `NullReferenceException` instead of ignoring your request, as you would expect. Workaround by initializing events with an empty delegate.

### Python

* **Indentation is significant**
    * Everyone notices this pretty fast.
    * Overall I think requiring correct indentation is a Good Thing™, as it contributes directly to *readable* code.
    * However this makes lambda expressions much less powerful than in other languages, since you can't easily nest statements inside a lambda expression without explicit braces (or similar delimiters).
    * Another side effect of having significant indentation is that the choice of tabs vs. spaces really matters. If you mix them, your program probably won't run.
* **Interactive interpreter (REPL)**
    * Amazingly useful for prototyping quickly, running experiments, and learning the language.
* **Collections are first class**
    * You can type `[1,2,3]` to get a list, `{'key': 'value'}` to get a dictionary, and `{1,2,3}` to get a set. So much faster than `new ArrayList<Integer>(...)`, `new HashMap<Integer>(...)`, or `new HashSet<Integer>(...)`.
* **Functions are first class**
    * You can declare them as literals, pass them around, and create higher-order functions that take functions as parameters.
    * Functions can also live on their own without an enclosing class, in contrast to Java. This is often the simplest approach for a given implementation.
* **"Magic" marked explicitly**
    * Anything "magic" that the language treats specially has names surrounded by double underscores.
    * For example:
        * An object's constructor is called `__init__`.
        * The method implementing an operator overload for plus is called `__add__`.
        * A class's metaclass is held by the `__metaclass__` field.
* **Generators** and **Coroutines**
    * Generators enable straightforward *pulling* of values from a complex data source (like a parsed data structure).
    * Coroutines enable straightforward *pushing* of values to a complex data sink.
    * Python calls both constructs a *generator*.

### JavaScript

* **No blocking I/O**
    * All I/O is non-blocking and asynchronous. This results in heavy use of [continuation passing style].
* **Successful despite huge flaws**
    * Ease of deployment and ubiquity (i.e. business considerations) trump ease of use. (PHP also wins for the same reason.)
    * A few flaws:
        * Everything is in the one global namespace.
        * No user-defined namespaces, modules, or importing of other files.[^js-no-namespaces]
        * No built-in facility for classes.[^js-no-classes]
        * Bizarre loose semantics for `==`.[^js-equality]
        * Multiple illegal value sentinels: `null` and `undefined`.[^js-truthy]
* **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
    * A fantastically compact, readable, and portable notation for representing all kinds of data structures. Great for data interchange.

[continuation passing style]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style

[^js-no-namespaces]: Hence workarounds like [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) to get includes and modules.

[^js-no-classes]: Hence reimplementions of class semantics in libraries like MooTools, Prototype, and [random blog posts](http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/). (That blog post has the best implementation, IMHO.)

[^js-equality]: Hence recommendations to always use `===` instead of `==`.

[^js-truthy]: Hence recommendations to only depend on the "truthy" and "falsy" values of expressions instead of direct comparisons with `null` or `undefined`.

### Haskell

* **Lazy evaluation**
    * Expressions are only evaluated when some primitive operation (like `print` or `add`) requires the value of the expression.
    * Allows you to define your own control flow operators.[^control-flow]
    * Allows you to extract complex expressions without fear of introducing a performance hit (since the expression will only actually be evaluated if it is needed).
* **Side effects banned by default**
    * Mutation of data structures and I/O, both of which have order-sensitive side effects, are not allowed except within the confines of **monad**.
    * A **monad** is a construct that explicitly controls evaluation order, in contrast to the usual unpredictable lazy evaluation behavior.
* **`null` banned by default.**
    * Unlike many languages, there is no special `null` value in Haskell that can be substituted anywhere.
    * Instead if a function wants to return a value of type `T` or null, you would declare the function as returning type `Option<T>`, which could either have the value `Some(tValue)` or `None`. When declared in this way, callers are *required* to handle both possibilies.
* **Type inference (+ static typing)**
    * The benefits of static typing without the need to specify the types for everything?  
      Count me in!

[^control-flow]: Want to implement Ruby's `until` loop or `unless` conditional? No problem.

### Lisp <small>(Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure)[^lisp-dialects]</small>

* **Homoiconic**
    * When you write a Lisp program, the notation you use (the *grammar*) is equivalent to what a compiler would see (an *abstract syntax tree* or *AST*).
    * Furthermore this Lisp code is represented as a nested structure of lists, symbols, and literals, all of which can be directly generated and manipulated in Lisp itself!
    * This allows Lisp code to generate list structures which can then be run as Lisp code directly.
        * Generation can be done at *compile* time with **macros**.
        * Generation can be done at *runtime* as well, and then invoked with **eval**.
    * However the highly uniform structure of Lisp code, devoid of operator and syntactic diversity, makes for lousy typography and thus low readability.
* **Macros**
    * A function that transforms the AST of its operands at *compile* time to new code.
    * Macros can be used to generate arbitrary new statements and control structures.
        * Domain specific languages, in particular, are very easy to implement in Lisp thanks to macros.
    * Macros can also be used to perform code optimizations at compile time[^macro-optimize] (similar to  "template metaprogramming" in C++).
    * Fluent use of macros requires the host language to be homoiconic, which is rare. Thus Lisp remains the only well-known language family that has macros.
* **Lisp Conditions and Restarts**
    * Allows bidirectional communication between different parts of the call stack. More powerful than exceptions, since conditions can not only unwind the stack but also wind it back again via a restart.
* **Call-with-current-continuation**
    * Allows you to save the current execution state of the program in a variable and jump back to it later. Multiple times, even. It's like a friggin' time machine. You can implement fairly complex control flow operators with this function.

[^lisp-dialects]: There are more dialects of Lisp than any other language I can think of. These 3 (Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure) are just the most popular dialects. I've directly used [Racket](/articles/2013/03/01/notes-on-racket/) in the past, which is itself a dialect of Scheme.

[^macro-optimize]: Prismatic performs efficient [compile-time DOM templating](http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2013/1/22/the-magic-of-macros-lighting-fast-templating-in-clojurescript) in ClojureScript using macros.

### Other

* **Fexprs**
    * A function whose operands are passed to it at runtime without being evaluated.
    * Similar to macros and lazy evaluation in terms of power.
    * Has fallen out of favor since the 1980s due to being difficult for compilers to optimize. Also it is hard to provide good error messages.
    * Furthermore most fexpr functions tend to rely on *eval* to continue evaluating its operands. The use of *eval* has its own problems...

<p>I love programming. It tickles me when I stumble across a new programming language that lets me express concepts in a more clear and direct fashion. I love the cleanness and order that results after a good round of refactoring<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I enjoy the challenge of hacking away at a fiddly problem and testing all the cases to get a correct and bulletproof solution.</p>

<p>However I have realized programming is merely an activity. It is a <em>means</em>, not an <em>end</em>. My work is not inherently valuable because I have created a piece of software. Rather it is because I have created software <em>that solves somebody&rsquo;s problem</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Therefore it is the <em>problem</em> that deserves the most attention if you want to make a difference that people care about.

<p><em><b>TLDR:</b> Drupal is overly complex for a personal blog. It is hard to maintain. Simple static site generators are easier to work with in the long term.</em></p>

<p>My portfolio website was written during college using hand-coded HTML and used server-side includes to bring in common navigation.</p>

<p>Then in January 2010 I remade my site in Drupal. It gained lots of fancy features such as first-class support for project categories and project languages. You could subscribe to almost any page as a feed. There were project specific updates that could be commented on. From a feature point of view, it rocked.</p>

<p>But some problems became apparent over time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security updates were frequent and difficult to apply correctly.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t like writing articles on the site because I couldn&rsquo;t use simple markup formats such as Markdown.

<ul>
<li>Drupal has no good editor plugins for markup languages.</li>
<li>And its visual HTML editor generates messy HTML.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The theme I used for the site was complex and hard to modify.

<ul>
<li>And the CSS often interfered with my article markup, necessitating me to drop into HTML when editing certain articles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There was no sane way to test structural changes to the site locally and then automatically deploy them to production.

<ul>
<li>Normally this would be done by keeping the site structure in the filesystem and all user content in a database. This allows the filesystem contents to be easily deployed using <code>git push</code>, <code>rsync</code>, or similar techniques.</li>
<li>Drupal, by contrast, keeps its site structure in both the filesystem <em>and</em> in the database, along with user-generated content. Updating only the parts of the database related to site structure is cumbersome and error-prone.</li>
<li>Thus, I couldn&rsquo;t really change the site structure after my initial deployment to production.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nothing was in revision control, which made me nervous.</li>
<li>I had to hack the Drupal core to get my contact form to work with my web hosting provider.</li>
<li>Most of the features of the site weren&rsquo;t being used by readers.</li>
</ul>


<p>So now I am rewriting my site yet again in straight HTML (via a simple static site generator) and outsourcing all user generated content (like comments) to third party service providers.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple simple simple.</li>
<li>Automatic security. The web server just serves static files.</li>
<li>Automatic scalability, for the same reason.</li>
<li>Simple authoring in Markdown with powerful client-side text editors.</li>
<li>Instant deployment with <code>git push</code>.</li>
<li>Everything in revision control.</li>
<li>I can use any web hosting provider. Hell, I can just use <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> for free.</li>
<li>Ultimate control over the site theme and CSS. I can fix problems myself.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The old Retrospect 6.0</h2>

<p>In the past I have used Retrospect 6.0 to backup my Macs, since it was one of
the few programs that reliably backed up everything correctly, with all the
metadata intact. But it is looking much less attractive these days&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It no longer finds my laptop on the network reliably, due to some bug.
Especially when switching between wireless and wired networks.
Thus I often miss backups.</p></li>
<li><p>It is slow.</p></li>
<li><p>It does not groom backups.</p></li>
<li><p>It stores everything inside a single monolithic file,
which is at risk of corruption.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>The new Retrospect 8.0</h2>

<p>The latest version of Retropect (8.0) is somewhat better but has some problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It does not seem to backup all attributes correctly.
For example, volume icons do not seem to be restored correctly.
Inaccurate backups are useless.</p></li>
<li><p>It is more complicated to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic grooming, although supported, is so slow to be practically unusable.
It takes maybe 2x as long to do one grooming operation as an incremental backup.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Time Machine</h2>

<p>Now there is Time Machine. Since my primary systems are 10.5+, I can use it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It <em>should</em> support reliable backup of all filesystem attributes,
since it was made by Apple, who is in a position to know about them.
Also, Apple typically makes solid products.</p></li>
<li><p>It has quick, automatic, incremental backups.</p></li>
<li><p>It also grooms automatically while it is backing up. Grooming behavior is
intelligent, keeping snapshots at sensible intervals.</p></li>
<li><p>The single-file restore interface is precise, intuitive, and fast.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Only wrinkle is that Time Machine is not really designed to backup to network
drives, however there are <a href="http://code.stephenmorley.org/articles/time-machine-on-a-network-drive/">instructions for circumventing this</a>.
(Of course there is Time Machine + Time Capsule for network backups, but a
Capsule is egregiously expensive.)</p>

<h3>2012 Update</h3>

<p>Time Machine misses a few filesystem attributes that Retrospect 6.0 nailed back
in the day, like volume icons.</p>

<p>I think it may also strip HFS+ extended attributes, since applications appear
to be quarantined after they are restored from a Time Machine backup.</p>

<p>One last nitpick is that TM has very poor handling for bad media and bad blocks.
In particular if your primary hard drive develops bad blocks, which is an early
sign of imminent failure, Time Machine will choke and refuse to backup the
entire volume. And this is exactly at the time you need it your files backed up
the most, when your hard drive is likely to fail.</p>

      <li id="BusinessA *killer app* is any product that is so desirable that it fuels the sale/adoption of a larger technology that the product depends on.

The gaming industry has been aware of the power of killer apps for a while, and often seeks to create launch titles for their new gaming systems that are killer apps. Microsoft, for example, deliberately created the first Halo game at same time as their Xbox console. And Nintendo has repeatedly introduced new Mario titles with its new consoles.

<!-- Similarly, some of the classic examples of killer apps were the first entrants in new software categories: word processors (WordStar) and spreadsheets (VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3). -->

However what may not be so obvious is that killer apps exist for learning new software platforms as well, such as for APIs, SDKs, and programming languages.

Learning a new platform (along with the associated tools and ecosystem) takes a large investment of *time*, and so there is a similar barrier to adoption as, say, the monetary cost of buying a new game console.

I think the platform-builders in the software industry could learn from the gaming industry and strategically introduce killer apps alongside new platform offerings.  I can think of no prior case where this was done deliberately (see the Appendix below), so I think our industry (i.e. software) is really missing out.

[^outlook]: Although Microsoft has finally created a version of Outlook for the Mac, it is buggy and missing a number of advanced features of the Windows version. Thus two of my colleagues <!-- Neeraj and Dee --> who do a lot of planning run Outlook specifically on Windows despite the workplace being otherwise Mac-oriented.<p>In April 2008, a representative from IBM gave a presentation at Georgia
Tech about things he wished he knew before working in the the software
industry. I have found his advice to be very useful at various points during
my career. Sadly I have lost the presenter&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>Here is my outline of his presentation. <strong>Emphasized</strong> points are ones I&rsquo;ve found
to be particularly useful.</p>

[^outlook]: Although Microsoft has finally created a version of Outlook for the Mac, it is buggy and missing a number of advanced features of the Windows version. Thus two of my colleagues <!-- Neeraj and Dee --> who do a lot of planning run Outlook specifically on Windows despite the workplace being otherwise Mac-oriented.<p>In April 2008, a representative from IBM gave a presentation at Georgia
Tech about things he wished he knew before working in the the software
industry. I have found his advice to be very useful at various points during
my career. Sadly I have lost the presenter&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>Here is my outline of his presentation. <strong>Emphasized</strong> points are ones I&rsquo;ve found
to be particularly useful.</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<ul>
<li>Future: integration</li>
<li>Needed: ease-of-use &amp; less complexity</li>
<li>Do <em>not</em> reinvent wheels!

<ul>
<li>you&rsquo;ll never finish the project</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Technical Knowledge</h3>

<ul>
<li>Learn to learn</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t need to take a class to learn something</li>
<li>Learn a little about a lot of things</li>
<li>Read news highlights from worthwhile sources</li>
</ul>


<h3>Problem Solving</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build a network of people. Asking for advice is quicker than learning the hard way.</strong></li>
<li>There is always more than one way to do something.<br/>
Weigh the pros/cons of each – then pick and choose.</li>
<li>Innovate <em>before</em> you execute. Think critically before you act.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Business &amp; Technology</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Technology adoption is driven by <em>business</em>. (practicality)</strong></li>
<li>Business is nothing without technology.<br/>
Technology is nothing without business.</li>
<li>If you build a better mousetrap, they will not come.</li>
<li>A project, no matter how advanced, is doomed for failure without a paying customer.</li>
<li>Think about TCO (<em>total</em> cost of ownership) and ROI (return on investment).<br/>
You must always justify your returns.</li>
<li><strong>Communication with <em>managers</em> and <em>customers</em> is vital!</strong><br/>
If you can&rsquo;t get someone to adopt your solution, what&rsquo;s the point?</li>
<li>There is a difference between removing barriers and creating incentive (for a customer to switch to my project/product). You need both.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Promotions</h3>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not <em>what</em> you know.<br/>
It&rsquo;s not <em>who</em> you know.<br/>
<strong>It&rsquo;s <em>who</em> knows <em>what</em> you know.</strong></li>
<li>Doing more of the same is not enough.

<ul>
<li>Need to try new things – take on more responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Doing what is asked is not enough.</li>
<li>Ask you manager what the expectations are.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Working with Others</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Credit + gratitude are not limited resources.</strong>

<ul>
<li>Say thank you!</li>
<li>Give credit where due.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be ambitious but be humble.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t make assumptions about others.

<ul>
<li>Give people the benefit of the doubt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;Your lack of planning does not mean I need to treat your request as urgent.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Do what you say you will. Keep your word.

<ul>
<li>reliable</li>
<li>dependable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The best humor is <em>self-deprecating</em>.</li>
<li>There is always someone faster, smarter, and better looking.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Managers</h3>

<ul>
<li>They don&rsquo;t have a magic wand. They don&rsquo;t automatically fix problems.</li>
<li>Managers do not have a superset of the employees' (team members') knowledge.</li>
<li>Managers can&rsquo;t read minds. Don&rsquo;t assume. Communicate explicitly.</li>
<li>You are responsible for your own career. But ask for help.</li>
</ul>


<h3>You and Your Job</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your job is what you make of it. Don&rsquo;t be confined by a job description.</li>
<li>Work/Life balance doesn&rsquo;t have good default settings. You must do <em>explicit</em> actions.

<ul>
<li>plan</li>
<li>schedule for success</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are not your job. Do not define yourself like this.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Workers</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>We&rsquo;re employed to <em>add value</em>, not spend money.</strong></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s easy to stay busy, but are you accomplishing anything <em>worthwhile</em>?

<ul>
<li>don&rsquo;t needlessly clutter your schedule</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you aren&rsquo;t looking at it from a <em>customer perspective</em>, you aren&rsquo;t looking at it.</li>
<li><strong>You can&rsquo;t do everything. Pick what you <em>won&rsquo;t</em> do.</strong> (The world won&rsquo;t end.)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Employment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t expect your first job to be your dream job. Look for a <em>path</em>, not an <em>endpoint</em>.</li>
<li>Be willing to stretch your comfort zone.

<ul>
<li>geographically, work type, etc.</li>
<li>Otherwise you&rsquo;ll stagnate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Know your employer&rsquo;s business model.

<ul>
<li>Examples:

<ul>
<li>HP = selling ink;</li>
<li>Microsoft = selling Office and Windows;</li>
<li>Apple = iPod and (to some extent) Macs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take a look at the annual reports for your company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Get <em>internships</em>, even if with competitors, maybe even delaying graduation.</strong>

<ul>
<li>It gives experience.</li>
<li>Increases employment opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Start looking and prepare much earlier.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Successful Employment</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you want to make a difference, look for chaos.<br/>
Stable environments offer little opportunity.</li>
<li>Good employees <em>deal</em> with challenges instead of pouting. <em>Adapt</em>.</li>
<li>Stay above the commodity line (with regard to skill set and type of work done).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Life</h3>

<ul>
<li>Understand other people&rsquo;s <em>motivations</em>.

<ul>
<li>Makes it easier to find new ways of solving the underlying goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Define your values and goals.

<ul>
<li>ex: What type of job do you want?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your <em>behaviors</em> should support your goals.</li>
<li>Expect your goals to change. Success is dynamic.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t let <em>others</em> define success for you.</li>
<li>You can get rich by getting more or <em>wanting less</em>.</li>
<li>Life is one great balancing act.

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s no single right way of doing things.</li>
<li>Balancing your priorities and goals is important.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>I love programming. It tickles me when I stumble across a new programming language that lets me express concepts in a more clear and direct fashion. I love the cleanness and order that results after a good round of refactoring<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I enjoy the challenge of hacking away at a fiddly problem and testing all the cases to get a correct and bulletproof solution.</p>

<p>However I have realized programming is merely an activity. It is a <em>means</em>, not an <em>end</em>. My work is not inherently valuable because I have created a piece of software. Rather it is because I have created software <em>that solves somebody&rsquo;s problem</em>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Therefore it is the <em>problem</em> that deserves the most attention if you want to make a difference that people care about. In that vein I have been learning about the precepts of Customer Development and Customer Discovery, which deals with how to efficiently interact with customers to discover a problem that they care about.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Direct customer interaction, such as through in-person interviews of the general public, is way outside my comfort zone. However I will persevere. I think it is a very important skill for actually making a dent in the universe.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

">BusinessA *killer app* is any product that is so desirable that it fuels the sale/adoption of a larger technology that the product depends on.

The gaming industry has been aware of the power of killer apps for a while, and often seeks to create launch titles for their new gaming systems that are killer apps. Microsoft, for example, deliberately created the first Halo game at same time as their Xbox console. And Nintendo has repeatedly introduced new Mario titles with its new consoles.

<!-- Similarly, some of the classic examples of killer apps were the first entrants in new software categories: word processors (WordStar) and spreadsheets (VisiCalc and Lotus 1-2-3). -->

However what may not be so obvious is that killer apps exist for learning new software platforms as well, such as for APIs, SDKs, and programming languages.

Learning a new platform (along with the associated tools and ecosystem) takes a large investment of *time*, and so there is a similar barrier to adoption as, say, the monetary cost of buying a new game console.

I think the platform-builders in the software industry could learn from the gaming industry and strategically introduce killer apps alongside new platform offerings.  I can think of no prior case where this was done deliberately (see the Appendix below), so I think our industry (i.e. software) is really missing out.

### Appendix

#### Examples for Programming Languages

Killer apps for languages:

* Ruby on Rails -> **Ruby**
* Django -> **Python**
* Emacs -> **Lisp**

Killer ecosystems for languages:

* iPhone -> **Objective-C**
* Android -> **Java**
* *embedded scripting in games* -> **Lua**[^wow-lua]

Killer features for languages:

* *interface with OS natively* -> **C**, **Objective-C** (OS X)
* *garbage collection* -> **Java**
* *hack together a deployable dynamic website fast* -> **PHP**
* *general-purpose scripting* -> **Python**
* *interprocess scripting on OS X* -> **AppleScript**

#### Other Software Examples

* GitHub -> **Git**
* Outlook -> **Windows**[^outlook]

      <li id="OfftopicToday I decided to explore the realm of Tor Hidden Services, which can be identified via URLs that appear to be on an `.onion` top-level domain.

The first hurdle is getting to your first site, since all domains have gibberish-looking names:[^no_verify_by_name]

* **Core.onion** ([eqt5g4fuenphqinx.onion](http://eqt5g4fuenphqinx.onion/))
    * The original starting point for many users since 2007.
    * I began my exploration here.

## Finding Things

The first thing you realize is that there are *no search engines*.[^search_engines] Instead you have to resort to the primitive method of recursively following links from previous sites you found. Bookmarks are essential. It's like 1995 all over again.[^corpnet]

Directory service sites exist with the sole purpose of listing links to other sites:[^directory_site]

* **TorDir** ([dppmfxaacucguzpc.onion](http://dppmfxaacucguzpc.onion/))
    * The original directory site (to my knowledge) since 2007.
* **The Hidden Wiki** ([kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion](http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page))
    * The original popular wiki, running the same Mediawiki software as Wikipedia.
    * The main purpose seems to be acting as a directory, although there are a few other interesting articles as well. <!-- http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/The_Matrix -->
    * Sadly the moderators seem to be losing against spammers, who repeated change links on the home page to redirect through a certain `coinurl.com` site. Thus it is necessary to go through [older revisions of the main page](http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&oldid=52408) to get anything useful.

And also:

* **TorList** ([torlinksysgthcbz.onion](http://torlinksysgthcbz.onion/))
    * A newer, more limited, and less organized directory. Moderated.
    * Useful because all its links fit on a single page, so it is a decent starting point.

## Parallel Worlds

For most popular websites on the public internet, there is a clone in Onionland.

* Twitter -> **TorStatusNet** ([lotjbov3gzzf23hc.onion](http://lotjbov3gzzf23hc.onion/))
    * Microblogging.
* Gmail / Hotmail -> **Tor Mail** ([jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion](http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/))
    * Free email service.
    * Can communicate with regular email addresses too.
    * Although rumored to be unreliable. <!-- http://utup22qsb6ebeejs.onion/?p=149 -->
* 4chan -> **TorChan** ([zw3crggtadila2sg.onion](http://zw3crggtadila2sg.onion/imageboard/))
    * Imageboard. NSFW.

I can only assume human wants must be fairly consistent.

## Commerce

The universal currency for making transactions is [BitCoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/), probably because it is far less traceable than standard currency.

It's really surprising and a bit disturbing what can be purchased: drugs, weapons, assassinations&nbsp;(!!!), among other things. <!-- (No links for you!) -->

## Final Thoughts

It feels really weird being in a part of the internet that is completely unreachable from Google (or any normal search engine). Much like visiting another country the laws, norms, and aesthetics are different.[^another_country] It is an interesting place to visit, but perhaps not the most desirable place to live.


[^no_verify_by_name]: Since domain names basically consist of gibberish, it is not practical to verify whether you are at the authentic URL for a domain, since it is hard to remember and recognize the domain name. Thus it relatively easy to get redirected to a spoofed version of a website and not be aware of it. Certain sites like **Black Market**, which I can only assume have been spoofed a lot in the past, take special measures such as putting the (gibberish) domain name in the site logo and instructing visitors on the main home page to check the domain name explicitly. Hardly a reliable solution.

[^search_engines]: Okay, there are are few search engines such as **DeepSearch** ([hpuuigeld2cz2fd3.onion](http://hpuuigeld2cz2fd3.onion/)) and **The Abyss** ([nstmo7lvh4l32epo.onion](http://nstmo7lvh4l32epo.onion/)), but they're about as effective as WebCrawler was back in the day.

[^corpnet]: If your corporate intranet or wiki has no decent search facility (likely), it's the same feeling of not being able to find anything. The only company I've worked for that had *good* internal search was Google (circa 2008). Microsoft sure didn't (circa 2011), although they were using some third-party engine internally, not Bing.

[^directory_site]: The only directory services site on the public web I still know of is the [Open Directory Project](http://www.dmoz.org). It's been a long time since I've used them.

[^another_country]: Instead of travelling to another country physically, you can try browsing the internet in a different language, which is similarly partitioned from the English internet. For example Germany's Facebook is [studiVZ](http://www.studivz.net/). China's Google is [Baidu](http://www.baidu.com). Naturally you need to be able to read the language in question to try this exercise seriously.
-topic"><a href="/articles/topics/#OfftopicToday I decided to explore the realm of Tor Hidden Services, which can be identified via URLs that appear to be on an `.onion` top-level domain.

The first hurdle is getting to your first site, since all domains have gibberish-looking names:[^no_verify_by_name]

* **Core.onion** ([eqt5g4fuenphqinx.onion](http://eqt5g4fuenphqinx.onion/))
    * The original starting point for many users since 2007.
    * I began my exploration here.

## Finding Things

The first thing you realize is that there are *no search engines*.[^search_engines] Instead you have to resort to the primitive method of recursively following links from previous sites you found. Bookmarks are essential. It's like 1995 all over again.[^corpnet]

Directory service sites exist with the sole purpose of listing links to other sites:[^directory_site]

* **TorDir** ([dppmfxaacucguzpc.onion](http://dppmfxaacucguzpc.onion/))
    * The original directory site (to my knowledge) since 2007.
* **The Hidden Wiki** ([kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion](http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page))
    * The original popular wiki, running the same Mediawiki software as Wikipedia.
    * The main purpose seems to be acting as a directory, although there are a few other interesting articles as well. <!-- http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/The_Matrix -->
    * Sadly the moderators seem to be losing against spammers, who repeated change links on the home page to redirect through a certain `coinurl.com` site. Thus it is necessary to go through [older revisions of the main page](http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&oldid=52408) to get anything useful.

And also:

* **TorList** ([torlinksysgthcbz.onion](http://torlinksysgthcbz.onion/))
    * A newer, more limited, and less organized directory. Moderated.
    * Useful because all its links fit on a single page, so it is a decent starting point.

## Parallel Worlds

For most popular websites on the public internet, there is a clone in Onionland.

* Twitter -> **TorStatusNet** ([lotjbov3gzzf23hc.onion](http://lotjbov3gzzf23hc.onion/))
    * Microblogging.
* Gmail / Hotmail -> **Tor Mail** ([jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion](http://jhiwjjlqpyawmpjx.onion/))
    * Free email service.
    * Can communicate with regular email addresses too.
    * Although rumored to be unreliable. <!-- http://utup22qsb6ebeejs.onion/?p=149 -->
* 4chan -> **TorChan** ([zw3crggtadila2sg.onion](http://zw3crggtadila2sg.onion/imageboard/))
    * Imageboard. NSFW.

I can only assume human wants must be fairly consistent.

## Commerce

The universal currency for making transactions is [BitCoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/), probably because it is far less traceable than standard currency.

It's really surprising and a bit disturbing what can be purchased: drugs, weapons, assassinations&nbsp;(!!!), among other things. <!-- (No links for you!) -->

## Final Thoughts

It feels really weird being in a part of the internet that is completely unreachable from Google (or any normal search engine). Much like visiting another country the laws, norms, and aesthetics are different.[^another_country] It is an interesting place to visit, but perhaps not the most desirable place to live.


[^no_verify_by_name]: Since domain names basically consist of gibberish, it is not practical to verify whether you are at the authentic URL for a domain, since it is hard to remember and recognize the domain name. Thus it relatively easy to get redirected to a spoofed version of a website and not be aware of it. Certain sites like **Black Market**, which I can only assume have been spoofed a lot in the past, take special measures such as putting the (gibberish) domain name in the site logo and instructing visitors on the main home page to check the domain name explicitly.
