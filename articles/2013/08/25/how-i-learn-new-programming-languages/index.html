    <p>I don&rsquo;t learn new programming languages very often. It simply requires an enormous amount of time to properly understand the local philosophy, community, tools, and ecosystem. But every so often I see a glimmer in an unfamilar language that merits me picking it up.</p>

<p>Very recently I decided to learn Clojure to fulfill my future needs for a high-power language<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Before embarking on this journey, I thought it would be valuable to reflect on how I&rsquo;ve learned other languages in the past and why I learned them.</p>

<p><a id="my-journey"></a></p>

<h2>My Journey</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>HyperTalk &amp; HyperCard</strong> &ndash; Play

<ul>
<li>This was my first programming language, first used at age 6.</li>
<li>The HyperCard environment was sufficiently well designed that I could <em>play</em> with existing programs, copy bits and pieces to assemble my own, and eventually build components from scratch.</li>
<li>The physicality of the system, the straightforward syntax, and the composability of program elements enabled this kind of play. I do not know of any programming environments today in which this would be possible.

<ul>
<li>Visual Basic is promising, although I&rsquo;ve never used it. It has physicality and native graphics.</li>
<li>DarkBASIC is also promising for making 3D games, although I haven&rsquo;t used it for anything serious. It has native 3D graphics.</li>
<li>Python has a REPL that you can experiment with and has reasonably straightforward and consistent syntax. However it has no native graphics and no physicality.</li>
<li>Processing has a built-in graphics. But it&rsquo;s not designed for composability at all, meaning that you can&rsquo;t mix and match parts from different programs. Its function naming is also haphazard and inconsistent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>My game <a href="/prism/projects/dungeons/">Dungeons</a> was the most advanced program I wrote in HyperCard. Other kids at National Computer Camp would line up at my computer who wanted to play it. I was very proud.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>BASIC, Pascal</strong> &ndash; Instructional Setting

<ul>
<li>At age 8 I picked these languages up at National Computer Camp because the instructors insisted on learning them before going on to other languages. <!-- With my prior two years of HyperTalk and general programming experience, I blew through these languages very quickly. --></li>
<li>These were my first compiled languages.</li>
<li><p>Neither of these languages were distinctive enough for me to keep using.<br/>
I did no major projects in these languages.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>C, C++</strong> &ndash; Brute Force, Instructional Setting

<ul>
<li>I learned these to interface directly with the Mac operating system and to do programs in color, since HyperCard only supported black &amp; white graphics.</li>
<li>I also had some instructional assistance at National Computer Camp during the summer.</li>
<li><p>I wish I could remember how I internalized pointers and manual memory management, since these are some of the most confusing bits of these languages for beginners. And most annoying for experts.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Java</strong> &ndash; Brute Force

<ul>
<li>I initially learned Java in 2001 when I tried to write RealMediaFixer in C++.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> When doing this I discovered that CodeWarrior&rsquo;s buffered I/O implementation was busted on Mac OS, behaving in a nondeterministic fashion. So I picked the most similar-looking language to C++ I&rsquo;d heard of, namely Java, and ported RealMediaFixer to use it instead. It worked on the first try and I didn&rsquo;t look back to C++ for several years. (After all, why would I use a language where <em>I/O</em> was broken?)</li>
<li>I just wrote tons and tons of programs in Java for the next 8 years or so, through the rest of middle school, high school, and college.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
<li>I also had some early instructional assistance at National Computer Camp. I am forever grateful to whatever instructor introduced me to the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/">Java API documentation</a>, allowing me to teach myself arbitrary parts of the Java standard library without relying on books or tutorials. Once you can teach yourself, the learning game is really on.</li>
<li><p>My Java decompiler <a href="/prism/projects/decomp/">decomp4</a> was the most advanced program I wrote in Java.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Python</strong> &ndash; Targeted Large Projects

<ul>
<li>While interning at Google in 2008 I noticed that they had three primary languages: Java, C++, and Python. Since Google engineers were the smartest group of developers I&rsquo;d ever run into, I figured they might be on to something with Python. So I started reading about Python and its capabilities.</li>
<li>My first attempt at a real program was the implementing of DiskSurveyorX in late 2008, a disk space visualizer.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Unfortunately the best GUI toolkit available in Python, wxPython, I found to be far too clunky to use. So I ended up reverting to implementing in Java using the Swing toolkit.</li>
<li>My second and successful attempt to write a substantial Python program was <a href="/projects/crystal-web-archiver/">Crystal Web Archiver</a> in late 2011, a website downloader and archival system.

<ul>
<li>Again I had to use wxPython. This time though I ended up writing an abstraction layer over the worst parts to remove much of the pain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Python is currently my favorite language for general purpose programming. Particularly for scripting, data analysis, and other kinds of exploratory work.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong> &ndash; Socialization, Brute Force (via Employment)

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS since mid-2012 to create rich web applications, primarily in the form of Splunk&rsquo;s app development framework. JavaScript was chosen because it is the lingua-franca of web development and because of its enormous leveragable ecosystem of libraries such as JQuery, Backbone, and Bootstrap.</li>
<li>Advanced JavaScript is almost impossible to learn on your own because there is no patron company that controls it nor is there a Benevolent Dictator for Life to provide officially blessed documentation or tutorials for how to use the language effectively. And this language has a sufficiently large number of design flaws that you need to learn to use it in a <em>disciplined</em> fashion.</li>
<li>I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get far in JavaScript without help from my coworker Itay who was already proficient. Should you not have access to such a resource probably the next-best thing is to look for non-trivial projects on Github and read them. For example I learned a lot by playing with <a href="http://browserquest.mozilla.org/">BrowserQuest</a> and reading its <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/BrowserQuest">source code</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><a id="patterns-of-learning"></a></p>

<h2>Patterns of Learning</h2>

<p>The primary patterns observed in my learning journey above include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Play</strong> &ndash; undirected learning, by oneself

<ul>
<li>This only works well with exceptionally well-designed programming environments. Sadly there are very few modern environments that fit the bill.

<ul>
<li>HyperCard is dead. Visual Basic is dying. DarkBASIC is not well known.</li>
<li><p>Processing and Racket work okay but have some issues.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Brute Force</strong> &ndash; writing lots and lots of programs

<ul>
<li>This method will certainly give you the most understanding. It also takes the most time.</li>
<li><p>Having access to a mentor to check your work is useful but not required.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Targeted Large Projects</strong> &ndash; writing a small number of projects geared toward getting the most experience

<ul>
<li>This is similar to the &ldquo;brute force&rdquo; approach but is more <a href="http://expertenough.com/1423/deliberate-practice">tactical</a>. It also requires more mental effort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>These primary patterns are coupled with a few secondary patterns:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Instructional Setting</strong> &ndash; taking a class to learn basic and intermediate skills

<ul>
<li>I only found taking classes to be useful when my programming foundations were weak. Such classes provide very little value to me today.</li>
<li><p>Note that taking a class isn&rsquo;t enough by itself. You have to practice on your own outside the class and after the class is finished.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Socialization</strong> &ndash; working with other developers to learn intermediate and advanced skills

<ul>
<li>Some things you can only learn efficiently from other developers.</li>
<li>Socialization is particularly useful for learning things in a highly fragmented ecosystem (such as JavaScript) or in settings with advanced concepts (such as overall program architecture or the functional programming paradigm).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><a id="appendix"></a></p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>There are a few languages I learned enough of to decide they weren&rsquo;t worth using in new projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>PHP</strong> &ndash; most widely deployed server-side web language

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">Just say no.</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ruby</strong> &ndash; used primarily as a server-side web language

<ul>
<li>Insufficiently distinct from Python.</li>
<li>Poor backward compatibility guarantees. No release notes.</li>
<li>Sloppy design: <a href="http://madhadron.com/posts/2014-11-10-languages_for_humans_and_subhumans.html">Non-formal grammar.</a> Syntax schizophrenia. Monkeypatching accepted as a valid practice. Mutable strings. <!-- Non-uniform string representation. --></li>
<li>But superior packaging, dependency management, and isolation systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

It however had some nice usability improvements pulled from my learnings from the information visualization class I took at the Technische Universität München. A modern disk space visualizer that uses a similar visualization is <a href="http://www.daisydiskapp.com/">DaisyDisk</a>, which I highly recommend.<a href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<p>For desktop GUI development, the Java + Swing combination is still my favorite. Followed closely by the Objective-C + Cocoa + Mac combination. I don&rsquo;t care about GUI programs on Windows or Linux. However now practically all GUI development is going to the web, where solutions based on HTML + CSS + JavaScript reign supreme.<a href="#fnref:5" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
